<h2 class="p6">PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_V" id="Page_V">v</a></span></p>

<p>The Cathedral verger, conducting his flock of
tourists round the building, while giving them
plenty of really interesting and valuable information
about it (for the verger of to-day is a different man
from his predecessor, and is often very intelligent
and well informed), remarks briefly, "The glass is of
the thirteenth century"&mdash;or fourteenth or fifteenth,
as the case may be; the procession gazes carelessly
at it, and passes on. Yet from out of that
dazzling and glowing labyrinth of coloured jewels
a past age is speaking far more articulately, if one
stops to unravel the message, than ever in stone or
wood, and it is for those who can be induced to
take that second look which will be followed by a
third and a fourth and many more that I have
written this book.</p>

<p>It is impossible in a book of this size to give an
adequate review of all the important windows even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VI" id="Page_VI">vi</a></span>
within the limits of place and time which I have
set myself. I have therefore chosen for study certain
typical windows in each century, and have written
about them some of the things which interest me
and which, I hope, will interest others.</p>

<p>The work of the countries and period I have
chosen is of course the most important of all.
There is beauty, it is true, in much Renaissance
work (only a prig could resist the gaiety and charm
of the windows of St. Vincent at Rouen), but it is
for the most part beauty achieved in spite of, and
not through, the material. There is beautiful
mediæval work in Germany and Italy, but the
Germans, till the Renaissance, clung to a rather
lifeless and archaic convention, and the Italians
were hampered by their greater knowledge of
painting. The art has found its noblest expression
in the work of the great school which for nearly the
whole of the Middle Ages was common to France
and England.</p>

<p>There is especial reason why we English should
study the work of our own mediæval glass painters.
They are the chief representatives of our primitive
school of painting. It is true that there are
English manuscripts in the museums, and there are
the painted rood screens of Norfolk, including the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VII" id="Page_VII">vii</a></span>
superb example at Ranworth, and there is the
portrait of Richard II. at Westminster; but of the
painting which must once have covered the walls
of our churches, there is little left but patches of
faded colour clinging here and there to the plaster,
and the occasional dim outline of a figure. Of our
glass, on the other hand, in spite of four hundred
years of destruction, a considerable quantity remains,
and is worth far closer study than it has ever had.</p>

<p>I must gratefully acknowledge the help I have
had from my brother, Mr. T. K. Arnold, especially
in writing of the Canterbury glass of which he
has made a very close study. My thanks are
also due to Mr. Noel Heaton for information on
the chemical composition of glass.</p>

<p>The publishers are fortunate in having been able
to reproduce, for the illustrations, the very beautiful
coloured drawings of Mr. Lawrence B. Saint,
which are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p>

Era. Its traditions do not extend back beyond
the great times of Gothic architecture, and it is
to the work of those times that the student must
turn, as the student of sculpture and architecture
turns to that of the ancient world, to learn the
basic principles of the art.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages stained glass formed an
important part, but still only a part, of that interior
colour decoration without which no church was
considered complete; but in spite of its fragile
nature it has on the whole survived the attacks
of time, the fury of the Puritan, the apathy and
neglect of the eighteenth century, and the sinister
energies of the nineteenth-century restorer better
than the painting which once adorned the walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
and woodwork, and for this reason has come to be
considered in these days as peculiarly appropriate
to churches. So much so, indeed, that whereas
I have sometimes found in country parishes a
certain amount of opposition to any attempt to
revive wall-painting as savouring of popery, no
such feeling seems to exist with regard to coloured
windows.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The process.</p>

<p>Stained glass is not one of the arts in which
the method of production reveals itself at the first
glance. Indeed, so few people when looking at a
stained-glass window, whether a gorgeous and
solemn one of the thirteenth or fifteenth century,
or a crude and vulgar one of the nineteenth,
realize the long and laborious process by which
the result, good or bad, has been obtained, that
a short description of that process as finally
perfected some five hundred years ago may not
be out of place here.</p>

<p>One hears it so often spoken of as "painted
glass"&mdash;Mr. Westlake calls his book <i>A History
of Design in Painted Glass</i>&mdash;that it is not surprising
that there should be a good deal of misconception
on the point. It must be clearly understood then
that the colour effects which are the glory of the
art are not directly produced by painting at all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
but by the window being built up of a multitude
of small pieces of white and coloured glass&mdash;glass,
that is, coloured in the making, and of which the
artist must choose the exact shades he needs, cut
them out to shape, and fit them together to form
his design, using a separate piece for every colour
or shade of colour.</p>

<p>In twelfth and thirteenth century windows many
of these pieces are only half an inch wide and from
one to two inches long, and few are bigger than
the palm of one's hand; so the reader can amuse
himself, if he wishes, in trying to calculate the
number of pieces in one of the huge windows of
this date in the Cathedral of Canterbury, York, or
Chartres, and the labour involved in this, the initial
stage of the process.</p>

<p>When the window is finished these pieces are
put together like a puzzle and joined by grooved
strips of lead soldered at the joints, just as any
"lattice" window is put together (and until glass
was made in large pieces this was the only way of
filling a window); but before this is done the
details of the design&mdash;features, folds of drapery,
patterns, and so on&mdash;are painted on the glass in an
opaque brownish enamel made of oxide of iron and
other metals ground up with a "soft" glass (<i>i.e.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
glass with a low melting-point). This is mixed
with oil or gum and water in order to apply it, and
then the glass is placed in a kiln and "fired" till
the enamel is fused on and, if well fired, becomes
part of the glass itself. This is the only "painting"
involved in the production of a stained-glass window,
and its effect, in the hand of an artist, besides
enabling him to express more than could be done
merely with glass and lead, is to decorate and
enrich what would otherwise be somewhat crude
and papery in effect.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The two
parts of the
process.</p>

<p>The process thus consists of two parts. The
cutting and putting together of the glass is called
<i>glazing</i>, and it is this that gives the window colour;
while the enamel work is spoken of as <i>painting</i>, and
gives detail, richness, and texture.</p>

<p>I shall presently show that the glazing and
painting are really two separate crafts, having
separate origins and development, and that stained
glass as we know it, or as it should be called in
strict accuracy "stained-and-painted" glass, is the
product of their union.</p>

<p>There is another method, far inferior in the
beauty of its results, by which pictures can be
produced in glass, which is to paint on white
glass with transparent coloured enamels. As,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
however, this method was not used till the seventeenth
century, and is now once more almost
wholly abandoned, it does not concern us here.</p>

<p>The softness of lead which makes it the only
practicable metal for joining pieces of glass of
complicated shapes, has the disadvantage that a
stained-glass window when leaded up has a considerable
degree of flexibility, and, if held by the
edges alone, would be quite unable to resist the
pressure of the wind, which on a big window is
enormous,&mdash;think of the power even of a fresh
breeze on a boat's sail.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The iron-work.</p>

<p>It would not even be able to support its own
weight for long, and so it follows that it must
be held up by a system of short metal bars
fixed firmly into the stone-work. Naturally the
design of the window must be so arranged that
these bars either do not interfere with it or form
an integral part of it. In early windows, especially
those of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and
even to some extent in those of the fourteenth, the
bars are sufficiently important to form the governing
factor in the design.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that stained glass loses
in beauty by the presence of these black lines of
lead and iron. On the contrary it gains enormously.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Large pieces of unrelieved colour in windows are
thin in effect and trying to the eye, which needs
the continual contrast of the solid black of the lead
all over the window to enable it to appreciate the
colour and brilliance of the glass. The painting
when rightly used is directed to the same end, for
it may be said that the smaller and more divided
the spaces of clear glass, the more brilliant and
jewel-like is the effect.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Silver stain.</p>

<p>To the rule that a separate piece of glass must
be used for every change of colour, there are, in
later work, two exceptions. The most important,
which was discovered early in the fourteenth
century, is the use of silver stain. It was then
found that if white glass is painted with a preparation
of silver&mdash;either oxide or chloride of silver
will do&mdash;and then "fired" in the kiln used for the
enamel painting, it will be stained a clear and
indelible yellow, varying from pale lemon to deep
orange, according to the strength of the painting.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Abrasion.</p>

<p>The other exception was Abrasion, effected by
the use of what is called "flashed" glass. Flashed
glass is glass so made that instead of being coloured
all through, it consists of a thin film or "flash" of
colour on a backing of white. With this glass it
is possible to chip with a burin, or grind away, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
coloured film in places (we do it now with hydrofluoric
acid) so as to get white and colour on the
same piece of glass.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i029" id="i029"></a>

<p class="caption">PLATE II<br />
PART OF CRUCIFIXION WINDOW, POITIERS<br />
Late Twelfth Century</p>
</div>

<p>In the Middle Ages only red and certain shades
of blue were made in this way, so the use of the
process was very much restricted. The invention
of silver stain, on the other hand, by enabling the
artist to decorate his white glass and make it
interesting, led him at once to use a larger quantity
of white in his window, and so, as will be seen
later, had a considerable influence on design.</p>

<p>These, however, are the exceptions which prove
the rule, and, broadly speaking, a stained-glass
window must consist, to the eye, of flat patches of
colour, large or small, worked on with dark monochromatic
line work and shading. These patches of
colour must each be separated from the next by a
black line&mdash;the leading&mdash;varying from a quarter to
half an inch in thickness, and crossed at intervals
by still thicker black lines&mdash;the iron bars.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Limitations
of the art.</p>

<p>It follows from this that anything like illusion
is impossible in stained glass, and no artist with any
sympathy for the medium would attempt it. Unwise
persons in decadent times have wasted much
ingenuity in the endeavour, but the result has
always been disastrous and ridiculous. Apart from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
its higher mission,&mdash;the expression of ideas and
emotions,&mdash;which it shares with every other branch
of art, the mission of stained glass is to beautify
buildings and nothing else. It is the handmaid of
architecture, and can only justify itself by loyal
service of its mistress. The ideal of the stained-glass
artist must not be a picture made transparent,
but a window made beautiful.</p>

<p>Let no one suppose, however, that the artist
is hampered by these limitations on the higher side
of his work. On the contrary, they set him free to
tell his story his own way. Ruskin&mdash;poor Ruskin,
out of date, ridiculed, forgotten&mdash;pointed out long
ago, in writing of Giotto's frescoes, the advantage
which the pure colourist has over the chiaroscurist
in his power of telling a story. In our times
the fact has been rediscovered with a flourish of
trumpets by the Post-Impressionists. I have no
great enthusiasm, I confess, for the way in which
they have carried out their principles, but I do
know two perfect tellings of the story of the
Creation. One is in mosaic on the ceiling of the
narthex of St. Mark's at Venice, and the other
is in the upper part of the east window of York
Minster; and in each case the language used consists
of flat forms and colour only.

<h2 class="p6">II<br />

THE BEGINNINGS OF STAINED GLASS</h2>

<p>I have said that stained-glass work is the product
of the union of two crafts, the glazier's and the
enameller's. The glazier's work being the groundwork
of a window, I will take it first.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Glass-making.</p>

<p>What, to begin with, is glass? It is sand melted
and run together. The best sand for the purpose
is that which is most largely composed of the
substance called silica, such as sand formed of
powdered quartz, or flint. For some reason, the
silica when melted does not recrystallize on
cooling as might have been expected, but forms
an even transparent substance, plastic while still
hot. Think of the tremendous effect this one
natural fact has had on the architecture, dress, and,
probably, the physique of the nations of northern
Europe.</p>

<p>Given sufficient heat, glass can be made by this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
means alone, but the heat required is so great that
it has only been done in recent years for special
purposes by means of the electric furnace. Failing
this, the sand must be induced to melt at a lower
temperature by means of a flux, for which either
potash or soda may be used, and to which lime or
lead must be added, to enable the glass to resist
moisture. (Theophilus, describing the process in
his Treatise, certainly no later than the thirteenth
century, recommends the use of beech twigs
calcined in an earthen pot, whence the name
"Pot-ash.")</p>

<p class="sidenote">Colouring.</p>

<p>Glass may be coloured or "stained" while in a
molten condition by the admixture of various
substances, mostly metals, gold, copper, manganese,
and so on, the result depending on the temperature
to which it is subjected and on the exact composition
of the glass as well as on the colouring matter
used.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Blowing.</p>

<p>Glass is made into vessels, as most people know,
by "blowing." The workman takes a dab of
molten glass on the end of a long metal pipe, and
putting his mouth to the pipe blows the glass&mdash;soap-bubble
fashion&mdash;into a hollow bulb. Then
by a rapid and dexterous series of alternate and
repeated heating, blowing, and spinning, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
manipulation with tools, most fascinating to watch,
he shapes it into the form required. If a flat sheet
be required for window glass it may be run out flat
when liquid, or blown as described above, and
worked into a cylindrical form, split open, and unrolled.
This is called "muff glass." But glass can
also be formed, by rapidly spinning it while soft,
into a large flat disc, called a "crown," and is then
known as "crown glass." It was by these last two
methods, the "muff" and the "crown," that all
the material of the windows we have to consider in
this book was made.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cutting.</p>

<p>When cold, the sheet or disc of glass may be
cut to the shape required, either, as in the old days,
by running a hot iron slowly along the proposed
line of fracture, in which case a crack will follow the
iron, or by scratching it with a diamond and then
bending it so as to break along the line of the
scratch. The latter is a comparatively modern
invention, and has in its turn been superseded by
the use of a little steel wheel with a sharp edge.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Pliny's story.</p>

<p>Pliny gives a story of the invention of glass
which, if false, is still so picturesque that I cannot
resist quoting it here.</p>

<p>A certain merchant-ship touched on the coast
of Syria, and the crew landed near the mouth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
the river Belus, on a beach of fine white sand
which, Pliny says, was still in his day of great
repute for glass-making. The ship's cargo consisted
of natron,&mdash;a natural alkaline crystal which was
much used in ancient times for washing,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;and
the crew having lighted a fire on the sand used
lumps of it from the cargo to prop up their
kettle. What was their surprise to find afterwards
a stream of molten glass running down from
their camp-fire. In this case the natron acted as a
flux and enabled the sand to melt in the heat of
the camp-fire, which, however, must have been a
very large and hot one.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Egyptian
glass.</p>

<p>Now, whether this story is true or not, it
cannot have been the beginning of more than a
local industry, for the art of glass-making was
known in Egypt from very early times indeed.</p>

<p>Its earliest use seems to have been in the
imitation of precious stones, and perhaps for this
reason it seems from the first to have been made in
colours as well as in white; but the art of blowing
it into vessels was certainly known in the fourth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
dynasty, and in some of the paintings in the tombs
the process is actually represented.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i041" id="i041"></a>
<a href="images/i_041l.jpg">

</a>
<p class="caption">PLATE III<br />
METHUSELAH,<br />
CANTERBURY, ORIGINALLY IN CHOIR CLERESTORY<br />
Twelfth Century</p>
</div>

<p>It was not, however, till the first century of the
Christian Era that any one seems to have thought
of using glass to fill windows. In Egypt naturally
the climate made it unnecessary, and even in Italy,
where it can be cold enough in winter, civilization
had evolved a style of architecture independent of
glass.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Roman
windows.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was introduced in Rome under
the first emperors. Caligula had his palace
windows glazed, and Seneca mentions it as one
of the luxuries which had been introduced into life
in his time, but which did not really add to a
philosopher's happiness. Its introduction was,
however, very gradual, and even two centuries later
its use was still quoted as evidence of excessive
luxuriousness.</p>

<p>Remains of these Roman windows have been
found at Pompeii and elsewhere. At Pompeii
they are in the form of small panes of glass held, in
one case in a wooden, and in another in a bronze
lattice.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It must be remembered that large panes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
were not available. Another method seems to
have been to set panes of glass directly into small
openings in stone-work.</p>

<p>When coloured glass was first used in windows
we have no evidence to enable us to say. As, however,
the manufacture of coloured glass was already
a flourishing art it cannot have been long before
the idea came of using it to decorate windows.</p>

<p class="sidenote">St. Sophia.</p>

<p>Whether the windows of St. Sophia at Constantinople
originally had colour in them or not, is not
quite certain. That they were glazed we know,
from the description of the church by Paul the
Silentiary, an officer of Justinian's court, but his
language about them is tantalizingly vague. From
his enthusiasm at the effect of the sunlight through
them I am inclined to suspect that they were
coloured, though he does not definitely say so. Of
this glass, which seems to have been fixed in small
rectangular openings in a slab of alabaster, nothing,
I believe, remains; but similar work&mdash;coloured&mdash;is
to be seen in other mosques, the only difference
being that the openings in the slab are formed into
patterns and kept very small. (I have already
mentioned the necessity, when dealing with <i>clear</i>
coloured glass, of keeping the pieces small and
contrasting them with plenty of solid dark.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Mahom&shy;medan
windows.</p>

<p>This was as far as stained glass in the East ever
got. The Mahommedan conquerors seem to have taken
the art as they found it, and continued it
down without much change almost to modern
times. Their religion debarred them from any
attempt to represent living forms, so that the art as
it stood sufficed for the needs of their architecture.
Visitors to Leighton House may see some of these
pierced and glazed lattices from Damascus, and
very beautiful they are. In them the pieces are
not much larger than a penny, and are set in holes
cut in plaster slabs, bevelled on the inside, the
glass being set at the outer edge of the hole. The
glass is not really of very good quality, but treated
in this way even thin poor glass looks rich and
jewel-like.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Glass in
the West.</p>

<p>What course the glazier's art first followed in
the West it is impossible to say, for nothing of it
remains earlier than the eleventh century, if as
early. Nevertheless, in spite of repeated barbarian
invasions, it seems never to have quite died out.</p>

<p>The Church, the refuge of the arts and civilization
in the general debacle, sheltered it, and from
being the luxury of the Roman millionaire it
became the ornament of the house of God. From
time to time we get allusions to glazed windows,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
but never a description that can throw much light
on their construction or design. Enough is said,
however, to show that coloured glass was sometimes
used. For instance, we read that St. Gregory of
Tours placed coloured windows in the Church of
St. Martin in that city in the sixth century.</p>

<p>One or two facts, however, lead me to think
that whereas, in the East, glass was set in stone or
plaster, in the West it was usually set in metal.
At Pompeii, as we have seen, panes of glass are set
in a bronze lattice and fixed with nuts and screws.
As colour was introduced it is probable that from
the necessity, already spoken of, of keeping the
pieces small, several bits would be joined together
with lead to fill one opening of the rigid lattice,
and so patterns could be formed. Leo of Ostia
says his predecessor, the Abbot Desiderius, filled
the windows of the Chapter-House at Monte
Cassino in the eleventh century with coloured
glass, "glazed with lead and fixed with iron"; and
certain it is that the earliest existing windows consist
of a large rigid lattice of massive rebated iron
bars, in which leaded panels have been placed
separately, and held there by light cross-bars passed
through staples and keyed with wedges.</p>

<p>If this conjecture is correct, we may assume
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
that the art of the glazier had for some time been
perfected, and had progressed as far as was possible
for it unaided, when its union, probably in the
tenth century, with that of the enameller gave
birth to the art of "stained-and-painted" glass&mdash;that
is, stained glass as we know it.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The opaque
enamel.</p>

<p>Without the use of enamel the glazier's craft
must always have been strictly limited to patterns
in glass and lead, or, as we now call it, "plain
glazing." What was needed to convert it into the
art as we know it was the addition of painting in
the black or brown monochrome enamel described
in the first chapter.</p>

<p>Only one who has worked in glass, and seen his
work grow from a map-like combination of white
and coloured glass to the finished glass painting,
knows the power the enamel gives him of controlling,
softening, and enriching his effects of colour. The
power it gives of suggesting form is only one,
and not the most important, of its functions,
and it was as vital to the work of the twelfth and
thirteenth as of the fifteenth century. With its
introduction the glorious windows of the Middle
Ages became possible.</p>

<p>Exactly when and where the application of the
enameller's craft to glass windows first took place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
it is impossible to say with certainty; but there is
some reason to suppose that it was in France, and
not earlier than the tenth century.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Venetian
enamellers.</p>

<p>Enamel&mdash;the art of painting on metal with an
easily fusible glass ground to powder, which is then
fused on to its groundwork in a furnace&mdash;was of
ancient invention, and had been carried to a high
state of perfection in Constantinople in the eighth
and following centuries. Thence by way of Venice
it had come to France, where a colony of Venetian
craftsmen had established itself before the end of
the tenth century.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Monk&shy;wearmouth.</p>

<p>France was already famous for its glaziers: for
instance, when in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 680 the Abbot, Benedict
Biscop, glazed the windows of the monastery at
Monkwearmouth, we read in Bede that "he sent
messengers to Gaul to fetch makers of glass (or
rather artificers) till then unknown in Britain....
They came, and not only finished the work required,
but taught the English nation their handicraft";
and it is probable that the French glaziers, chafing
under the limitations of their art, called in the aid
of the Venetian enamellers. It is noteworthy that
no attempt seems to have been made to use transparent
coloured enamel on glass. That mistake
was reserved for the decadence of the art seven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
hundred years later. Perhaps experiment convinced
them that enamel colour could never hope
to rival the depth and richness of coloured glass, and
the glazier would realize that what he wanted of
the enameller was not colour but black, to modify
and enrich the colour which his glass already gave
him in full measure. In this book, therefore, the
word "enamel," when used in connection with
glass, must be understood to refer, unless coloured
enamel is specifically mentioned, to this brown
opaque enamel or "paint," as glass-workers call it.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cloisonné.</p>

<p>But the enameller's art had another influence on
that of stained glass. A form of enamelling developed
at Constantinople and practised at Limoges
was that known as "cloisonné." In this, narrow
strips of metal are soldered edgeways to the groundwork
and the spaces between are filled with differently
coloured enamel, the different colours being
thus separated by strips of metal.</p>

<p>When the enameller's attention was first turned
to glasswork, in which different coloured pieces of
glass were separated by strips of lead, he must have
been struck with the similarity of the two arts, and
have perceived that the style of design already
developed in enamel could be applied with little
change to glasswork.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>This probably explains not only the apparently
sudden birth of the art fully formed, but the
strongly Byzantine character of the design in the
earliest work, the enameller's art having been
brought, as we have seen, from Constantinople by
way of Venice.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>What, then, is the oldest "stained-and-painted"
glass in existence? At Brabourne in Kent there
is a small window, of which a coloured tracing may
be seen in South Kensington Museum, which may
belong to the eleventh century. It consists of a
simple pattern of white glass and leading, with
small pieces of colour inserted at intervals. Some
of these latter, however, have been formed into
rosettes of simple design by means of opaque
enamel, which is the only painting in the window
at all. Whatever the actual date of the window, I
think it is not unlikely that it shows the manner
in which enamel painting and glazing were first
combined.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Early
window at
Le Mans.</p>

<p>Almost the earliest glass, however, to which any
date can be approximately assigned are the panels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
in Le Mans Cathedral,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which are illustrated by a
sketch of Mr. Saint's in <a href="#i004">Plate I.</a></p>

<p>In a thirteenth century manuscript preserved
at Le Mans it is recorded that Bishop Hoel, who
occupied the See from <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1081 to 1097, glazed
the windows of the Cathedral with stained glass,
"sumptuosa artis varietate," and it is just possible
that this glass, which was found in 1850 scattered
and glazed up among fragments of a later date,
may be part of the glass referred to.</p>

<p>It seems to have formed the lower part of a
window representing the Ascension, and consists of
figures of the Virgin and the Twelve Apostles
"gazing up into Heaven."</p>

<p>The arrangement is very simple. There seems
to have been little or no ornament in the window,
and the figures in white and coloured draperies,
standing on conventionalized hillocks which represent
the top of the "high mountain," are relieved
against a background of plain colour in alternate
panels of red and blue. In this window and for
long afterwards the background represents nothing
in nature, but merely serves the purpose of throwing
up and isolating the figures.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>As the glass is not in its original position, one
can only guess at its original construction and
design. All early windows, as I have said, consisted
of separate leaded panels inserted into the openings
of a massive metal framework, an arrangement
which of necessity governed the design. In this
case one would expect the six panels, with their
differently coloured backgrounds, each to have
filled a separate opening in the framework.</p>

<p>If this is so, however, the panels must have
been somewhat cut down, since as at present
glazed the limbs and drapery of the figures
occasionally overlap into the neighbouring panels.
I think it very probable indeed that the glass has
been so cut down, and that the window at Poitiers,
illustrated in <a href="#i029">Plate II.</a>, though of later date, gives
a true idea of the original relation of these panels
to the iron-work. It is probable too that the upper
part of the Le Mans window was filled with a
figure of the ascending Christ on the same plan
as that of Poitiers. It is, indeed, only fair to say
that the Poitiers window, which is of the end of
the twelfth century, throws some doubt on the
greater antiquity of that at Le Mans.</p>

<p>There is little or no ornament in the latter, and
perhaps there was never much, though it may have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
once had simple borders between the panels and
a rich border like that at Poitiers (not shown
in the drawing) surrounding the whole. The
technique followed in the painting is precisely
that which obtained for nearly three hundred
years after. That is to say, as far as possible the
effect is obtained by glazing, and the features and
folds of drapery are put in with strong, dark,
sweeping lines of enamel. The style of the
drawing, however, both in the figures and the
drapery, is perhaps more purely Byzantine than
any later work. The sweeping lines of the
drapery are graceful and decorative, but the
action of the figures is absolutely conventional.
There is none of that feeling for motion which,
expressed in line, gives so much vigour and
animation to the subject windows of the thirteenth
century.</p>

<p>In colour, however, which after all is the most
important thing in a window, this glass is splendid,
and for the quality of the material and the way
in which it has resisted the attacks of time it is
superior to much glass of a later date.

<h2 class="p6">III<br />

THE STYLE OF THE FIRST PERIOD</h2>

<p class="sidenote">The three
periods.</p>

<p>Stained glass from its birth to the Renaissance has
been divided by Winston into three main periods,
each having broad characteristics peculiar to
itself, and which he named after the corresponding
architectural styles, Early English, Decorated, and
Perpendicular. As, however, these terms only
apply to English work, and as the architectural
styles do not altogether correspond in date with
those of the glass, I prefer to speak simply of the
First, Second, and Third Period.</p>

<p>The First lasts from the earliest examples almost
to the end of the thirteenth century, and might
be subdivided again into twelfth and thirteenth
century work, between which there is a distinct
difference.</p>

<p>The Second covers nearly the whole of the
fourteenth century.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>The Third lasts down to the end of the fifteenth
century, by which time the influence of the classic
Renaissance began to be felt in glasswork, but lingers
on in belated examples well into the sixteenth.</p>

<p>Between each of these periods there is a very
short transitional period lasting hardly a decade,
and occupying the closing years of each century.</p>

<p>It must not be thought, however, that at any
time design in stained glass stood still. Its history
is rather one of periodic impulses, due no doubt to
the work of individual genius, followed in each case
by a long and gradual decline, towards the end of
which artists began to grow restless and feel about
for new modes of expression, and so prepare the way
for the next impulse of genius.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The First
Period.</p>

<p>The broad characteristics then which distinguish
the First Period are&mdash;</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>(1) Its rich colour.</li>
<li>(2) Its mosaic character.</li>
<li>(3) The importance of the iron-work and its influence on the design.</li>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">Its rich
colour.</p>

<p class="p2">(1) <i>Its Colour.</i>&mdash;The colour of the glass in this
First Period is of a barbaric richness, unequalled in
the succeeding periods. A very deep and splendid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
blue is used, in contrast with the greyish-blue of
later glass, and it is of an uneven tint, which greatly
adds to its quality. The ruby,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> too, is often of a
streaky character and of great beauty. These two
usually form the dominant colours in the window,
the greens, yellows, and purples being used rather
to relieve them.</p>

<p>So much is the artist in love with his deep reds
and blues, which he nearly always uses for the
backgrounds of his figures, that he seldom insults
them by painting on them except in so far as is
necessary to the drawing, reserving his enamel
mainly for the decoration of his whites and paler
colours, keeping them in their places by a delicate
fret of line and pattern work.</p>

<p>It is only towards the latter part of the period,
when the quality of the glass began to fail a little,
that he ever covered the whole surface of a blue
background with an enamelled diaper, to give it a
depth and richness which was lacking in the glass
itself.</p>

<p>Except in the grisaille windows to be described
later, in which a definitely white effect is aimed at,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
the amount of colour used in proportion to the
white glass is considerably greater than in succeeding
periods. Nevertheless the white is always
present, running everywhere among the colour like
a silver thread, relieving and beautifying it. In
fact it was not till modern times that any glass-worker
ever thought he could do without it.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Its mosaic
character.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Mosaic Character of the Glass.</i>&mdash;The
designer depends for his effect primarily upon glass
and lead, and builds up his window out of tiny
pieces. He had learned the jewel-like effect this
gave to his work, and seemed to grudge no labour
in it. Take, for example, the Ark at Canterbury
in <a href="#i053">Plate IV.</a> Where a fifteenth century painter
would have been content to make the ark of
perhaps only one piece of glass, probably of white,
getting his detail in enamel and silver stain only,
our thirteenth century craftsman has used over
fifty pieces, purple, blue, red, yellow, green and
white, and that in a space less than a foot square!
He was a colourist par excellence, and his waves,
too, are blue, greenish-blue and green, with caps of
white foam&mdash;all a mosaic of glass and lead.</p>

<p>From this dependence for its effect on the
actual material used, it follows that the work of no
period is more easily damaged than this by so-called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
"restoration." The introduction of only
half a dozen pieces of crudely coloured modern glass
is often enough to upset the whole harmony of the
colour and to make the window irritating instead
of restful to the eye. In France, indeed, so few
windows of this period have been left unrestored
that the period does not always get justice done it.
I doubt if many people honestly get much pleasure
from the effect of the windows of the Sainte
Chapelle at Paris taken as a whole; but if you
notice how much of the original glass is in South
Kensington Museum you will understand the
reason.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
iron-work.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The Influence of Iron-Work.</i>&mdash;The windows
of this period consisted from the first, as we have
seen, of separate leaded panels inserted into the
openings of an iron lattice. This lattice was
formed of iron bars of a <span class="b12">T</span>-shaped section, the head
of the <span class="b12">T</span> being outwards, and having staples at
intervals on the inner rib, through which light
iron bars were thrust and keyed with wedges, to
hold the glass in its place.</p>

<p>In the absence of any tracery to assist in the
support of the glass, this iron-work in large windows
was of a massive character and could not be disregarded
in the design. In figure work there were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
two possible ways of dealing with it: one was to
make the figures so large as to be independent of it;
and the other was to make the figures so small that
a complete figure-subject could be included in one
opening of the frame work.</p>

<p>Both these methods were used by the artists of
the early period. Where the work is far from the
eye, as in the clerestory windows, we usually find
large single figures&mdash;far larger, often, than life&mdash;filling
the whole window, like the big angel from
Chartres on <a href="#i113">Plate X.</a> and the smaller and older
figure of Methuselah from Canterbury on <a href="#i041">Plate III.</a>
When, on the other hand, the work is near
the eye, as in the aisle windows, they used
the other method, filling each opening of the
iron-work with a small subject-panel like that of
Noah and the Dove in <a href="#i053">Plate IV.</a>, thus producing
what is called the medallion window.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Medallion
windows.</p>

<p>At first the lattice work consisted merely of
upright and horizontal bars. These, it is true,
sometimes, as in the twelfth century window at
Poitiers in <a href="#i029">Plate II.</a>, were manipulated to fit the
subject, but more usually the subject fitted the
bars.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bent
iron-work.</p>

<p>In the earliest form of medallion window, such
as those in west windows at Chartres and some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
of the earliest ones at Canterbury, the window is
divided by the iron-work into a series of regular
squares, each of which alternately is filled with a
square and a circular figure-subject. Later, however,
in the thirteenth century, the iron-work
itself was bent into geometric patterns which
the medallions were shaped to fit, producing the
elaborate designs shown in the insets of the
whole windows in Plates <a href="#i053">IV.</a> and <a href="#i093">VIII.</a> from
Canterbury.</p>

<p>Even when in the latter part of the thirteenth
century there was a return, prompted no doubt
by motives of economy, to iron-work composed
of straight bars, the influence of these elaborate
lattices is still seen in the shapes of the medallions,
though these are no longer outlined by the iron-work
which now passes across or between them.
An example of this is shown in <a href="#i149">Plate XIV.</a> from
Rouen Cathedral.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The method
of painting.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The Method of Painting.</i>&mdash;This consists of
vigorous line work in the brown enamel, laid on
with a brush in beautiful, firm, expressive strokes
on a ground of clear glass. Lettering and patterns
are formed by being scratched out clear from a
solid coat of enamel. There is no attempt at
modelling in planes or at light and shade, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
half-tone is only used, as I shall presently explain,
to soften the edges of the line work.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Ir&shy;radiation.</p>

<p>Now the optical law which most affects the
technique of stained glass is that of which the
effect is known as "irradiation." In an unscientific
work it is enough to say that it is the law which
causes the filament of an electric light, in reality
thin as a hair, to appear when incandescent as
thick as a piece of worsted. In the same way it
makes the clear spaces of glass appear larger than
they really are in proportion to the obscured parts,
and also tends to make them look rounded.</p>

<p>From the fact that the glass between the line
work was left nearly clear, the work of this period
is more affected by irradiation than any other, and
the artist had to make his line work very black and
thick in order to tell at all, especially in work far
from the eye. For instance, if he wished to distinguish
the fingers of a hand he separated them
with solid black spaces as thick as the fingers
themselves.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The line
work.</p>

<p>The glass between the line work is left nearly
clear, but not quite; for if quite clear the intensity
of the light would have bitten into the edge of the
black line and made it appear what engravers call
a "rotten" line, or even be invisible altogether at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
a little distance. Therefore the painter softened
the edges of his line work by one of two methods.
The first, described by Theophilus, though I cannot
say for certain that it has been used in any glass
I have examined, was to slightly smear the painting
when wet with a soft brush. The other, which
seems to have been more used, was to edge the
dark line work, so to speak, with fainter strokes in
semi-transparent half-tone. In work that was
meant to be placed near the eye the line work is
extraordinarily fine and delicate, while in work
that has to be seen from a distance, such as the
clerestory windows of a cathedral, we find the
whole scale of the execution increased. Lines are
there used from half an inch to an inch thick, but
in every case the work is equally admirable for
its precision and vigour.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The "Matt."</p>

<p>In the later periods the half-tone shading
became developed into the "matt" or thin coat
of enamel laid evenly all over the surface of the
glass, from which, when dry, the lights were brushed
out and the line work became more and more
delicate. Still, as long as technique remained sound,
the strength of shading was really obtained by line
work, the matt or half-tone serving its true use in
softening the light and making the line work visible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>Renaissance glass painters, in their efforts to
produce the effects of oil painting in glass, tried to
get rid of the effect of irradiation altogether by
dulling the whole surface of the glass, with fatal
results to the beauty of the material.</p>

<p>To sum up, although the work of this period
may suffer in popular esteem from the drawing
being conceived in an archaic convention,&mdash;a convention
different to our own,&mdash;and from having
suffered from restoration, the fact remains that at
no time did the artist understand better the
possibilities and limitations of his art and adopt a
sounder technique in regard to them.

<h2 class="p6">IV<br />

TWELFTH CENTURY GLASS</h2>

<p>The few examples I have mentioned are the only
ones which can with any probability be dated from
the eleventh century, but of twelfth century work
much more remains.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Poitiers.</p>

<p>The window at Poitiers in <a href="#i029">Plate II.</a> shows little
if any change in style from the Le Mans window
in <a href="#i004">Plate I.</a> It is still almost pure Byzantine, and
if I were to judge by style alone I should place
this window very early indeed. A fragment of an
inscription has, however, been found on it&mdash;<span class="smcap">DITHANC
... BLAS</span>,&mdash;which has been thought
to mean that the window was the gift of one
Maurice de Blason, who became Bishop of Poitiers
in 1198. If so, and if we are right in identifying
the Le Mans window with Bishop Hoel's glazing,
a whole century separates the two.</p>

<p>The probable explanation is that the Byzantine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
style had lingered on in the south-east of France,
as it may well have done, whereas north of the
Loire a school had by this time arisen, and had
been flourishing for many years, which was producing
work both in France and England of a very
different and far more advanced character.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The school
of Chartres,
St. Denis,
and Canter&shy;bury.</p>

<p>The twelfth and early thirteenth century windows
at Chartres, St. Denis, Canterbury and Sens show
such resemblance to each other that there can be
little doubt of their common origin. As, however,
their execution covers a period of at least seventy
years, one man cannot have been responsible for
them all.</p>

<p>Probably they represent the work of a group of
men working together&mdash;perhaps never more than
half a dozen at one time&mdash;under a master who was
trained by his predecessor, and who in turn would
be succeeded in the leadership by the best of his
pupils. Several of these masters in succession
must have been men of genius, and thus between
them they evolved a style which, carried on by a
succession of lesser men, governed design in stained
glass for a century to come.</p>

<p class="caption">PLATE VII<br />
BORDER, FROM THE TRINITY CHAPEL, CANTERBURY<br />
Twelfth or early Thirteenth Century</p>
</div>

<p>The rise of this school is the first of the periodic
impulses to which I have referred, and the work
they produced was, for its dignity and grandeur,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
unequalled for two hundred years&mdash;if it has ever
been equalled at all.</p>

<p>The figure of Methuselah or "Matusale" in
<a href="#i041">Plate III.</a>, which is one of the few remaining of
the original figures once in the choir clerestory
at Canterbury (it is now in the S. Transept), is a
good example of their work, and a comparison of it
with the Poitiers window (which is actually later
in date but in the older style) shows the greatness
of the change they effected. The change is, in
fact, that from ancient to modern art: from
Byzantine, the last lingering survival of the great
classic tradition of Greece, to Gothic, the first
expression of the art of the modern world.</p>

<p>Who were these men and where did they come
from? Some would have it that there was a great
central school at Chartres, but there is little evidence
for it. When Abbot Suger built the great abbey
of St. Denis, which was dedicated in 1142, he filled
it with glass, "painted," says his secretary, Monk
William, "with exquisite art by many masters of
<i>divers nations</i>" ("de diversis nationibus"). Does
this mean that some of them were English or
Germans, or only men from other provinces than
the Ile de France? No one can say; but they
must have been working together to produce the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
results they did. One statement of the Monk
William's leads me to think that the work was
done on the spot. He says the work was very
costly, because they "used sapphires to colour their
glass." Now this is an obvious misunderstanding,
due to the practice, in those days, of describing
coloured glass by the name of the precious stone it
resembled, and such a mistake is most likely to
have been made in conversation with the artists
themselves.</p>

<p>It is, of course, always possible that they had no
permanent headquarters but took up their abode
in whatever city their chief work was for the time
being, there erected their furnaces, which the description
of Theophilus shows to have been simple
affairs, and remained there till their work was
completed&mdash;which must have taken some years in
every case&mdash;and then moved on to the next work.</p>

<p>Much has been made of the fact that a window
in Rouen bears the signature of one Clement of
Chartres,&mdash;"Clemens vitrearius Carnutensis me
fecit,"&mdash;but that window is a hundred and forty
years later than St. Denis. By that time the
whole Cathedral at Chartres had been filled with
glass, a task which extended over thirty years;
and Clement may well have learned his trade and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
passed from apprentice to master there. No other
artist of the school has signed his name anywhere,
nor has Clement anywhere else.</p>

<p>One can tell pretty well the order in which the
most important of their work which remains was
done. First Chartres and St. Denis,&mdash;so near
together that one cannot say which came first,&mdash;then
Canterbury, Sens, and then back to Chartres again,
where a fire had destroyed all but the west
windows. This, however, probably represents
only a small portion of their labours, of which
the rest has disappeared. For instance, a few
fragments set among later work in York Minster
have all the characteristics of this school; and
we know that Prior Conrad's choir at Canterbury,
which was completed in 1130 and destroyed
in 1175, was renowned for the splendour of its
glass, which may have been their work too.</p>

<p>A window at Le Mans, rather later than the
one illustrated, and which Mr. Westlake thinks
may be dated about 1120, shows signs of the new
movement. It consists of a series of subjects from
the stories of SS. Gervasius and Protasius, and
already shows the arrangement of small medallions
of simple shape, surrounded by ornament filling
the rectangular openings of the iron-work, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
from the fact that some of the medallions seem to
have been cut down, they are probably not in their
original position. In the drawing of the subjects
the artist is breaking away from the Byzantine
tradition. The new wine is bursting the old
bottles. He is a man in love with life, and when
he depicts a group of men stoning a saint he likes
to make them really throwing, and to show in their
faces, as well as he knows how, that they are
thorough ruffians.</p>

<p>Next in antiquity to this window, and some
twenty or thirty years later (1142-1150), come the
earliest of the windows at Chartres and at St.
Denis.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Chartres.</p>

<p>In the year <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1134 a terrible fire destroyed
the town of Chartres and so damaged the west end
of the Cathedral that it had to be pulled down and
rebuilt&mdash;a work which took some fifteen years to
accomplish, while the towers were not finished till
twenty years later still. The three windows over
the west door were filled with glass some time
between 1145 and 1150.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i093" id="i093"></a>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">The west
windows.</p>

<p>In early times churches seem to have been
peculiarly liable to destruction by fire, owing
perhaps to the number of wooden buildings by
which they were surrounded. The early history of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
every great cathedral is one of successive disastrous
conflagrations, after each of which the building
rises once more, larger and more splendid. Thus,
in 1194, another fire completely destroyed the
whole of the Cathedral with the exception of
the newly built west end, which included the three
windows in question. These escaped damage,
protected perhaps by the immense depth of their
embrasures, and still remain almost unimpaired to
this day, the largest and most perfect windows of
their time that have come down to us. In them
one feels that the new movement has found itself
and produced a great man.</p>

<p>Two of them, the central one, which is the
largest, being some 30 feet high and 10 wide,
and that on the south, are medallion windows, containing
scenes from the life of Christ. The bars
of the iron-work, which are about 3 feet apart,
divide them into a series of regular squares, which
are filled with square and circular medallions; in
the central window the figures in the medallions
are relieved against alternate backgrounds of ruby
and blue. The ruby of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries is a wonderful colour. It is never of a
perfectly even tint, each piece having, as it were,
its own character, and the colour seems to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
a slightly granulated or "crumbly" texture, which
gives it a quality unknown in later glass. So
beautiful was it evidently considered that the artist
seldom or never attempted to enrich it with painting.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Jesse
tree.</p>

<p>The third window, that on the north, is filled
with a "Tree of Jesse."</p>

<p>The subjects of stained-glass windows in this
First Period were chosen with one object&mdash;the
exposition of the Christian Doctrine, and of this
the human descent of Christ was an essential part.
Accordingly, at all periods in the history of
mediæval stained glass we find windows devoted
to the representation of "the Tree of Jesse."</p>

<p>The arrangement is always the same as in this
window at Chartres. The figure of Jesse lies
recumbent at the foot of the window, and from his
loins rises the "Tree"&mdash;a mass of branching scroll
work with conventional foliage, spreading over the
whole window, carrying on its branches David
and other human ancestors of Christ, and culminating
in the Virgin and Christ Himself at the
top of the window. On either side are ranged the
Prophets who foretold His coming, and the whole,
surrounded by a rich border, forms, at Chartres, a
mass of jewelled colour some 9 feet wide and 25
feet high.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>This window and the one of which a part,
identical in design, remains at St. Denis, are the
oldest examples I know of a Jesse tree in stained
glass, and whether or not they were the first to
be made, their design formed a model for others
for long after.</p>

<p class="sidenote">La Belle
Verrière.</p>

<p>The remainder of the windows in the Cathedral,
including the western rose, are of the thirteenth
century with one exception&mdash;the one in the south
choir aisle, which contains the great figure of the
Virgin known as "Notre Dame de la Belle
Verrière": the only window, as far as I know, to
which in former times people knelt by hundreds in
adoration, and before which they still occasionally
burn a candle.</p>

<p>The Virgin with the Child on her knee sits
enthroned in the upper part of the window, and
surrounded by angels, on a much smaller scale,
incensing and holding candles, while below are
medallions illustrating the Marriage at Cana and
the Temptation. The angels and the medallions
are of the thirteenth century, but the figures of
the Virgin and Child with their background are
almost certainly of the twelfth. Probably the
veneration in which they were held caused them
to be rescued from the fire,&mdash;hurriedly broken out,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
perhaps, from the surrounding glass,&mdash;and then
reset in thirteenth century work after the Cathedral
was rebuilt.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The Virgin is dressed in a robe of
pale greyish-blue, of a colour one seldom sees in
later work, relieved against a background of deep
ruby, set with jewels of a darker blue. The precision
of the colour harmony is wonderful, and no
drawing I have seen of the window gives, even in
outline, the beautiful poise of the head, bent in
gracious benediction.</p>

<p>Although I have said that the workers of this
school were breaking away from the Byzantine
tradition and looking at life with their own eyes,
yet it is never possible for men suddenly to produce
work wholly independent of tradition, even when
they are foolish enough to try; so we find in this
case Greek art, through Byzantine, retains enough
influence with these men to give to their work
a dignity and restraint which is lacking in that of
the thirteenth century. This is very noticeable
wherever one gets the two in close juxtaposition,
as at Chartres and also at Canterbury. There is
an impressive severity of design and a feeling for
proportion in the figure of the Virgin in La Belle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Verrière which one misses in the surrounding work,
which, though very beautiful, is by comparison
small and fussy in treatment.</p>

<p class="sidenote">St. Denis.</p>

<p>In the meantime, in 1142, while the west front
of Chartres Cathedral was still in progress, the
great Abbot Suger had finished the construction
of his abbey of St. Denis, near Paris. He was a
great patron of the arts, as well as a good man
and the first statesman of his age, and he seems
to have spared no pains in the decoration of the
church and especially in the filling of the windows
with stained glass. Of this glass, alas! only the
merest remnant is left, consisting of several
medallions and part of a "Tree of Jesse." They
have been collected and placed in the chapels of
the apse of the church, embedded in garishly
coloured ornament&mdash;the work of M. Gérente,
acting under the orders of the great and terrible
Viollet-le-Duc&mdash;which effectually prevents one
taking any pleasure in their beauty. They are,
however, very interesting to study. Whether
or not they were done before or after the three
windows at Chartres it is, I think, impossible to
say for certain. The history of the two buildings
shows that they must have been done within a
few years of each other (two of those at St. Denis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
contain figures of Suger as donor, and he died in
1152), and they are certainly the work of the same
school. The Jesse tree in particular is either a
copy, or the original, on a smaller scale, of the one
at Chartres, being almost identical in design.</p>

<p>Many of the medallions are interesting from
their deeply symbolical character. In one, for
instance, is Christ, with the seven gifts of the
Holy Spirit, represented, as in the Jesse tree, by
doves, each contained in a circle and connected
with His breast by rays. With His left hand He
unveils a figure labelled "Synagoga," and with His
right He crowns another figure labelled "Ecclesia."</p>

<p>Another very curious medallion represents the
<i>f&oelig;deris arca</i>, "ark of the covenant." A figure of
the Almighty supports a crucifix which rises from
the ark,&mdash;a square box on four wheels,&mdash;while round
about are the four symbols of the Evangelists.
The cross is thus shown as the symbol of God's
new covenant with man as the ark was that of
the old. A quaint feature is that the artist, while
feeling that all four wheels had got to be shown
somehow, has been in some difficulty as to how to
show the farther pair, and has therefore placed
them above the ark, as if resting on it, as an
ancient Egyptian artist might have done in his place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>In most of the medallions the teaching of the
subject is emphasized and the application pointed
out by rhyming Latin hexameters, doggerel in style
and innocent of prosody, such as:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>
Quod Moyses velat, Christi doctrina revelat.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The same feature is found in the glass at Canterbury.
None of the verses are identical, but the
literary style is the same.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Angers and
Chalons.</p>

<p>At Angers there are some remains of twelfth
century windows which are thought to be about
the same date as those of Chartres and St. Denis,
or even a little earlier, and there are some at
Chalons, but they cannot be dated with any
exactitude, and I have had no opportunity of
examining them. Next after these in point of
date should, I think, come the earliest of the
windows at Canterbury, though nearly thirty years
must separate the two.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Fragments
at York.</p>

<p>A few fragments in York Minster, however,
show where the artists may have been occupied
meantime. There are some scraps in the clerestory&mdash;scraps
of a Jesse window of which the details
are almost identical with the St. Denis work&mdash;and
a medallion representing Daniel in the Lion's Den,
which is glazed into the foot of the centre light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
of the great thirteenth century grisaille windows in
the north transept, known as "the Five Sisters."
It is a circular medallion filled out to a
square form with ornament, no doubt to fit a
square of the iron-work, and strongly resembles
the St. Denis work.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Canter&shy;bury
choir.</p>

<p>Of the stained glass of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, which was once the glory of Canterbury
Cathedral, only a remnant has escaped the zeal
of the Puritans. The minister placed in charge
of the Cathedral under the Commonwealth, one
Richard Culmer, known to his enemies as "Blue
Dick," though I do not know why, relates with
glee how he stood on a ladder sixty steps high
with a whole pike in his hand and "rattled down
proud Beckett's glassie bones."</p>

<p>I own I feel less resentment against "Blue
Dick," who at least thought the windows important
enough to smash, than against that later vandal
Wyatt, who in the eighteenth century sold the
glass at Salisbury for the price of the lead in it,
or those who even now in many places are letting
old glass perish for want of proper care.</p>

Twelfth and Thirteenth Century</p>
</div>

<p>Even "Blue Dick" seems to have tired of his
pious labours before they were quite finished, for,
of the early windows, he has left us two in the north
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
choir aisle, and four in the Trinity Chapel east of
the choir, in which most of the old glass remains.
Besides these there are many medallions and
numerous fragments scattered about in other windows
and embedded in the work of the modern
restorer, and several large figures from the clerestory,
of which the Methuselah in <a href="#i041">Plate III.</a>, now
in the south transept, is one.</p>

<p>In the year 1174, four years after Becket's death,
the splendid choir built by Prior Conrad in 1130
was completely destroyed by fire, and the monks
immediately set about building a new one. Gervase
the monk has left a detailed account of the progress
of the great work, year by year and pillar by pillar,
for the space of ten years, first under the French
master-builder, William of Sens, and then under
his successor, William the Englishman ("little in
body but in workmanship of many kinds acute
and honest"), so that we know just when each
part of the work was finished. Now in the spring
of 1180, he relates, the monks had a great desire to
celebrate Easter in the new choir, and to gratify
them the master, by a special effort, succeeded in
getting the building finished and roofed in almost
to the east end of the choir, where he placed a
hoarding to keep out the weather.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>Since we are told that in this hoarding there
were three glass windows, it seems reasonable to
suppose that the other windows were glazed too.
Now since both the windows in the north choir
aisle and, when in its original position, the
Methuselah on <a href="#i041">Plate III.</a> were well to the westward
of the point at which the hoarding was
erected, I have no doubt that they were in
position by this date, in which opinion I am
confirmed by the character of the glass itself.
That in the Trinity Chapel to the east of the
hoarding would naturally be later.</p>

<p>The same arrangement seems to have been
followed at Canterbury as elsewhere of having
large figures in the clerestory and small medallions
in the lower windows.</p>

<p>The Methuselah, which seems to have formed
one of a series of Patriarchs,&mdash;of which three others
remain, which filled the windows in the clerestory
of the choir,&mdash;is a particularly dignified figure, and
it is noticeable that the throne he is seated on is of
somewhat the same type as that of Notre Dame de
la Belle Verrière at Chartres. As in all windows
of this date, the flesh is executed in glass of a
brownish-pink colour instead of white, which later
on became the rule.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>This illustration shows very well the early
method of painting. Where possible, as in the rich
blue of the background, the glass is left quite clear.
The folds of the drapery and the features are drawn
in sure and vigorous line work. Diaper is used
very sparingly, only when it is necessary to "keep
back" and subdue a piece of glass, as in the case of
the green cushion to the throne and the border of
the tunic. If you can imagine the glass with these
pieces left clear or with any other piece diapered, you
will see how unerring has been the artist's judgment.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The letters of the inscription are scratched out
of a dark ground of enamel. This is the invariable
method used in early glass, which indeed is always
(except in grisaille, of which more later) conceived
as a light design on a dark ground. In the fifteenth
century the reverse was the case, and then we get
inscriptions in dark lettering on a light ground.</p>

<p>The arched form of the top of the background
shows how it once fitted a clerestory light, though
doubtless with a border, and the space above has
been filled with scroll work of, I think, the same
date, which may have come from some of the
medallion windows in the choir aisles.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>The two medallion windows in the north choir
aisle formed part, as we know from an old MS. still
in existence, of a series of twelve dealing with the
life and parables of our Lord.</p>

<p>In style they very closely resemble the St. Denis
work, perhaps a little further developed. Some of
the medallions, indeed, are almost identical with
those at St. Denis, notably that of the Magi on
horseback following the star. The figures are tall
and dignified, and both for drawing and decorative
placing are far better than much work of the
succeeding century. The Calling of Nathaniel is
a particularly good panel.</p>

<p>The westernmost of the two windows still
retains the early arrangement found at Chartres,
the iron-work consisting simply of straight bars
dividing it into a series of regular squares, which
are filled alternately with circular and square
medallions.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i113" id="i113"></a>
<a href="images/i_113l.jpg">

<p class="caption">PLATE X<br />

CHARTRES CATHEDRAL<br />

</div>


<p>The other one of the two has bent iron-work of a
very simple design, consisting simply of four circles
connected by straight bars, thus marking the transition
from one form to another; which is another
reason for dating these windows between the west
windows of Chartres, where the iron-work is all
straight, and those at Sens, where it is nearly all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
bent. The small scale-sketch in the corner of
<a href="#i053">Plate IV.</a> shows the arrangement of the iron-work
and the medallions. The panel of Noah in the
Ark is from one of the semicircles on the left
side of the window. The spaces between the
medallions are filled up with beautiful foliated
scroll work, on a ruby ground of the same character
as that round the head of Methuselah.</p>

<p>The arrangement of their subjects is so interesting,
forming one of the first and most complete
examples of a "type and antitype" window, that I
shall describe it in some detail.</p>

<p>In each of these two windows the upper two-thirds,
or thereabouts, of the glass is in its original
position, while the lower panels, smashed by the
pike of "Blue Dick," who seems at this point to have
got tired of going up his ladder, have been filled
with subjects from other windows of the series.</p>

<p>Down the centre run the subjects from the life
of Christ, while on each side are the "types" or
subjects from the Old Testament which illustrate
it. Thus the westernmost of the two, once the
second of the series, begins at the top with the
Magi following the star, while on one side is
Balaam, with the words of his prophecy, "There
shall come a star out of Jacob, etc.," and on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
other Isaiah, with the words, "The Gentiles shall
come to Thy light, and kings to the brightness of
Thy rising."</p>

<p>Next below we see in the centre the arrival of
the Magi before Herod, illustrated on the left by
the Israelites coming out of Egypt, led by Moses,
and on the right by the Gentiles leaving a heathen
temple containing an idol&mdash;a naked blue figure
(blue merely because the artist wanted some blue
there), and following Christ, by way of a font,
towards a Christian altar, while a demon above
their heads urges them to return to the idol. As
at St. Denis, each of the medallions has a Latin
rhyme attached, explaining and enforcing the
lesson. Here, for instance, it runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Stella Magos duxit et eos ab Herode reduxit,</p>
<p>Sic Satanam gentes fugiunt te Christe sequentes.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Next we see the Magi making their offerings
to the infant Christ, on one side of which is the
Queen of Sheba visiting Solomon and on the other
Joseph in Egypt receiving his suppliant brethren.</p>

<p>And so the series goes on. The twelve windows
when complete formed one of the most elaborate
sets of types and antitypes known, and included
not only the life of Christ but eight of His parables&mdash;for
some reason a very rare subject in mediæval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
glass. Two panels of the Parable of the Sower&mdash;the
seed falling among the thorns and the seed
falling by the wayside&mdash;remain, and have been used
to fill up the gaps at the bottom of this window.
Above is a curious subject&mdash;the Church with the
three sons of Noah, who hold between them the
world, divided into three regions. From the MS.
above mentioned we know that this was the type
to the "leaven which a woman took and hid in three
measures of meal till the whole was leavened"&mdash;an
idea taken, I think, from St. Augustine.</p>

<p>The subject of Noah and the Ark from the other
window was originally alongside the Baptism of
Christ, the purging of the world by the flood of
waters serving as the type for the purging of the
soul by baptism.</p>

<p>Altogether as one studies these windows one is
almost as much struck by the subtlety of thought
and earnestness of the teaching they embody as by
the glory of their colouring and grace of their
design.</p>

<p>In one of the triforium windows is some glass
which may perhaps be earlier even than this. It
consists of three medallions, only one of which
is at all perfect, which seem to be part of a life of
St. Alphege, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
martyred by the Danes. In the one perfect panel
which represents the storming of Canterbury by
the Danes, the warriors wear the long coats of mail
and kite-shaped shields of the Norman period as
shown in the Bayeux tapestry, and a ship in one of
the other medallions is exactly like those in which
William the Conqueror and his knights are there
shown crossing the sea. The obscure position of
this glass in the triforium is not where one would
expect to find a window devoted to St. Alphege,
who before the death of Becket was the most
important saint that Canterbury could boast; it
may be therefore that the medallions have been
moved from elsewhere, perhaps from Archbishop
Lanfranc's nave, or it may, for all we can tell, be
some of Prior Conrad's glass that has survived the
fire.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Vendôme.</p>

<p>Of other twelfth century work there is not
much in existence. There is a Virgin and Child at
Vendôme which somewhat recalls Notre Dame de
la Belle Verrière but has none of her grace, and I
have already referred to the window at Poitiers
illustrated in <a href="#i029">Plate II.</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">Poitiers.</p>

<p>This remarkable and impressive window, which
is over 26 feet high and nearly 10 wide, is one
of three, and occupies the central light of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Cathedral apse. The illustration does not show
the whole of it, for it is surrounded by a rich border,
which in its arrangement of alternate bunches of
foliage and knots of interlaced work resembles
that of the Jesse Tree at Chartres, and below the
Crucifixion is a four-lobed medallion showing the
Martyrdom of St. Peter, and the donor offering
a model of the window.</p>

<p>The design, as I have said, seems to show that
the Byzantine style had lingered on south of the
Loire, where no doubt the influence of the
Limoges school would be strong, and in view of
this fact it is rash to take the age of the Le Mans
"Ascension" altogether for granted.

EARLY THIRTEENTH CENTURY GLASS<br />
IN ENGLAND<br />
<br />
(CANTERBURY AND LINCOLN)</h2>

<p>In passing from the twelfth to the thirteenth
century one notices a certain loss of the restraint
and sense of proportion which gives such dignity
and refinement to the earlier work, but on the
other hand a certain gain in vivacity and facility of
expression. The Greek influence is dying out, but
the artists, though with less sense of design than
their predecessors, were accomplished at story-telling,
in which, however, they seem less serious
and more gossiping. Their figures are less tall, and
the lines of the drapery from being straight and
severe become agitated and flowing.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Trinity
Chapel,
Canter&shy;bury.</p>

<p>East of the choir in Canterbury Cathedral is the
Trinity Chapel, of which the building was finished
in 1185 and to which the body of St. Thomas was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
translated with great pomp in the year 1220 and
placed in a marvellous jewelled shrine, the position
of which can still be traced on the pavement by
the hollow worn round it by the knees of pilgrims.
All around were gorgeous windows which, with the
exception of those in the little circular chapel at the
east end, known as "Becket's Crown," were filled
with the stories of his posthumous miracles.</p>

<p>It is a little difficult to date these windows.
They cannot of course be earlier than 1185, but I
do not think that any of them are much later
than 1220, though from the fact that one of the
medallions, and one only, contains a representation
of the famous shrine&mdash;everywhere else it is the
martyr's tomb in the crypt that is shown&mdash;the
particular window containing it cannot have been
executed before the latter date, as the shrine would
not have been in existence. It may, however, have
been done in that year. This window and the one
next it seem to me to be by an inferior hand, and
contain certain features not found in the others, but
common in later glass of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Whether this represents a gap in the execution
of the windows it is, however, impossible to say
without the evidence of the windows which have
been destroyed. Seeing that from 1208 to 1213
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
the country was under an interdict, the existence
of such a gap would not be surprising.</p>

<p>None of the windows are entirely filled with
their original glass, but four of them are nearly so.
The gaps have been filled up with most ingenious
imitations of the old glass, executed from 1853
onwards by Mr. Caldwell, under the direction of
Mr. G. Austin, and so cleverly are they done that
they are very difficult to detect by the eye alone.
I do not think that "restoration" of old glass, by
which is usually meant filling up or replacing it by
imitation of the old work, is ever justifiable, but I
am obliged to admit that, if it ever could be so, it
has been justified here at Canterbury. I think there
is not much doubt that in these four windows, at
least, one can see the old glass better for the gaps
being filled up with colour than if they had been
left white. The principle, however, is a bad one,
and I have seen little "restoration" elsewhere that
did not disfigure the window.</p>

<p>Fortunately a most indefatigable lover of stained
glass, the Rev. J. G. Joyce, has left a series of
coloured drawings of the glass as it was in 1841
before restoration. These and his manuscript notes
are now in South Kensington Museum, together
with some coloured tracings by a Mr. Hudson, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
enable us to trace what has been done. From these
we learn that in his time the place of the Crucifixion
in the east window was occupied by a figure of the
Virgin from a Jesse window, proving that there was
once a Jesse window at Canterbury as well as elsewhere.
Judging from the tracing, the scroll work
of the "tree" follows closely the lines of those at
Chartres and St. Denis, but is a little more elaborate
and very beautiful. It seems to me more in
keeping with the earlier than the later work at
Canterbury. Unfortunately no one seems to know
what has become of it; but Winston who saw it,
quotes it in a lecture as "some of the oldest glass
in the country." If the Cathedral authorities have
got it stowed away anywhere I hope they will
some day place it in one of the empty windows
where it can be seen.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The east
window.</p>

<p>This east window, which is in "Becket's Crown,"
is one of the best preserved, only four or five of its
four-and-twenty medallions being new. It is an
example of an arrangement of subjects which
occurs also at Bourges and at Chartres, and to
which PP. Cahier and Martin in their work on
Bourges give the name of "La Nouvelle Alliance."
It represents, in fact, the foundation of the Church
of Christ, as embodied in His Passion, Resurrection,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
and Ascension, in the coming of the Holy Ghost,
and in the reign of the Son of Man on high, each
subject being accompanied and illustrated by
"types" from the Old Testament. Here, at
Canterbury, on one side of the Crucifixion&mdash;which,
though new, is doubtless a correct restoration as far
as the subject goes&mdash;is the sacrifice of the Passover,
and on the other is Moses striking the rock in the
desert, from whence, as from the side of Christ,
gushes the life-giving stream. Above is the
sacrifice of Isaac; and below, the spies returning
from Eshcol carrying the great cluster of grapes&mdash;a
type of the wine of the Sacrament.</p>

<p>Above this group come the Entombment (which
is reproduced in <a href="#i065">Plate V.</a>), the Resurrection, the
Ascension, the Descent of the Holy Ghost, and
Christ in Glory, each with its four types surrounding
it. The Resurrection is modern, and so is the
Escape of the Spies and the "Majesty." Noah
and his Ark is a modern copy of the one in the
north choir aisle, but the rest of the panels are
original.</p>

<p>The work seems to me fairly early in character,
but it is not so well drawn as that in the north
choir aisle, and there is not, to me, the same feeling
for line in it. It is, however, very beautiful, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the whole window is a shimmer of iridescent colour.
<a href="#i077">Plate VI.</a> shows some of the scroll work that fills
the spaces between the medallions.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Becket
windows.</p>

<p>The windows in the Trinity Chapel itself are all
devoted to the tale of the posthumous miracles of
the Blessed St. Thomas as related in the Chronicle
of Prior Benedict, which affords a key to the
pictures. The Chronicle is fascinating reading for
the homely light it throws upon everyday life in
England at the end of the twelfth century. By its
means we can trace in the glass the story of the
little boy who fell in the Medway while throwing
stones at frogs, three of which, very large and green,
are shown in the glass; of the workman William,
who was overwhelmed by a fall of earth while
digging a conduit near Gloucester; of the physician
of Perigord and many others, who were one and all
restored to life and health through prayer to the
Blessed Martyr. There, too, is the tale of Eilward,
whose eyes were put out by the magistrate for
having, when drunk, broken into the house of Fulk
(with whom he had quarrelled over a debt) and
taken a pair of hedger's gloves and a whetstone; to
whom St. Thomas, who seems to have thought the
sentence excessive, appeared in a vision, and with
a touch restored his eyesight. Here, too, we see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the awful vengeance of the saint on the knight,
Jordan Fitzeisulf, who, when his son was restored to
life, meanly neglected to make the offering he had
vowed at the Martyr's tomb.</p>

<p>Three of the windows on the north side are
fairly perfect, and two on the south side contain
many of their original medallions. Of those on
the north, one, the sixth from the west, is the best,
and might be by the same hand as the east window.
An interesting point about it is the border,
of which the design is identical with that of a
window at Sens which also deals with the history
of St. Thomas à Becket. As this window contains
the story of Jordan Fitzeisulf, I shall refer to it, if
I have to do so again, as the Jordan Fitzeisulf
window.</p>

<p>The other two, the fourth and fifth from the
west, are, I think, by an inferior hand, and contain,
as I have said, certain features not found in the
other windows, but common in later glass of the
thirteenth century. One of them, the fifth from
the west, is divided by the iron-work into four
great circles, each of which contains four pear-shaped
medallions, their points meeting in the
middle. The spandrils between them are filled
with scroll work on a ruby ground, not quite so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
good as those in the east window; but outside the
large circles&mdash;and this is the important point&mdash;the
ground is filled in with a regular mosaic of little
pieces forming a repeat pattern as shown in
<a href="#i093">Plate VIII</a>. This is the only instance at Canterbury of
this "mosaic diaper," as it is called, which is so
common in glass a little later, and which from the
fact that it could be done "by the yard," and if
necessary by an apprentice, was a much cheaper
method of filling in a background than by scroll
work, which it soon completely superseded.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that it is this window which in
its uppermost medallion contains the representation
already mentioned of the famous shrine, from which
the saint is issuing and addressing a sleeping monk,
who is thought to be the Prior Benedict, the
chronicler of the miracles.</p>

<p>In all the other medallions of the series it is the
tomb of St. Thomas in the crypt, easily recognizable
from the descriptions that remain, at which the
sufferers pay their vows, so that it seems probable
that the window was executed in, or soon after, the
year 1220, in which the saint's body was removed
to the shrine, but while the memory of the tomb
in the crypt was still fresh.</p>

</div>

<p>The other, the fourth from the west, has a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
remarkable peculiarity, very seldom met with in
glass of the Early Period at all. The blue background
to the figures in the medallions, which is
of a paler and poorer quality than in the other
windows, is covered all over with a thin "matt" of
enamel, from which a delicate diaper pattern has
been scratched out. Presumably the artist had for
some reason been unable to get any more of the
splendid deep blue glass, and used this means to
give richness and texture to his background. The
only other thirteenth century glass I know of in
which at all the same thing has been done is at
St. Urbain at Troyes, but that belongs, I believe,
to quite the latter part of the century. It was a
common device in the fourteenth century, but the
patterns used then were of quite a different character.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Lincoln.</p>

<p>Except for the grisaille windows at York and
Salisbury, the only other extensive remains of
thirteenth century work in England are those in
Lincoln Cathedral, which, however, are little more
than wreckage, and consequently very difficult to
date with any attempt at precision. The only
window in which any of the glass is in its original
position is the great rose window in the north
transept, and even this, though the original design
can still be made out, is much mutilated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>The lancets under the rose in the south transept
and the east windows of the choir aisles contain a
miscellaneous collection of medallions, separated
from their surrounding ornament and glazed in
with remains of thirteenth century grisaille. Other
medallions, too, have been used to fill gaps in the
north rose, and the south rose is filled, with the
exception of one light which retains its original
fourteenth century foliage pattern, with scraps
of thirteenth century ornament of which the effect,
with the sunlight twinkling through, is wonderfully
beautiful.</p>

<p>The medallions are not, I think, all of one date,
which is not surprising, for the filling of the
windows of a big cathedral must always have taken
many years. The difficulty of dating them is
increased by the fact that much of the painting
does not seem to have been so well "fired" as at
Canterbury, and in many cases has perished
altogether. This seems to have happened in recent
years, for Mr. Westlake shows many details in his
drawings of the glass which I cannot now distinguish.
Where the painting remains we find
that in a few of the medallions the drapery is drawn
in the stiff manner of the twelfth and very early
thirteenth century, but in most of them the later
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
more flowing treatment prevails. In some, too,
the blue of the backgrounds resembles that used
at Canterbury, but in many, and notably in the
north rose, it is of a purplish colour and much less
agreeable. In a few it is of quite a grey blue.</p>

<p>Nowhere can I trace the same hand as at
Canterbury, and the borders and ornament are
quite different; but that the artist had access to
some at least of the same designs is shown by a
medallion in the south choir aisle which represents
Noah receiving the Dove, and is practically a replica
of the Canterbury one in <a href="#i053">Plate IV.</a>, with a boat-like
hull added to the Ark. It is not, however, nearly
so good. According to Mr. Westlake the work at
Lincoln strongly resembles that at Bourges, and to
me it has something in common with that in the
Sainte Chapelle at Paris.</p>

<p>Lincoln Cathedral was not finished till after
St Hugh's death in 1199, so none of the glass
can be older than that. On the whole, I think
the bulk of the glass is a little later than any
but the very last of the work at Canterbury,
that it is by a different hand, and shows less
taste both in colour and design. Probably it was
done between 1220 and 1240.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The south
rose.</p>

<p>I am confirmed in this view by the examination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
of the fragments which fill the great south rose,
which consist entirely of thirteenth century
ornament and most probably once formed the
setting of these same medallions. A little of it is
scroll work, but the greater part is "mosaic diaper"
of the kind shown in <a href="#i093">Plate VIII.</a>, and which is so
characteristic of French work after 1220, whereas
we only find it beginning at Canterbury.</p>

<p>Some of the medallions are, however, very
interesting, the best being those in which the
drapery shows the earlier treatment. In the
north choir aisle is a good one of the Israelites
crossing a Red Sea of a fine streaky ruby, and
in the south choir aisle is one of St. Thomas à
Becket being conducted to Heaven by angels and
carrying the damaged top of his head in his hands.
By a touch of realism both parts of his head have
been made of glass that has slight ruby streaks
in it, giving it a gory appearance. This is the
earliest example I know of the deliberate use of
an accident of colouring in the glass to produce a
realistic effect.</p>

</div>

<p>Among the medallions which have been glazed
into the north rose is one representing the funeral
of St. Hugh of Lincoln in 1199, the coffin being
carried by three archbishops and three kings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
One of the kings was William of Scotland, and the
other King John of England (the only occasion on
which I know of that monarch appearing in a
pleasant light), but the artist must have put the
third king in for the sake of symmetry as there is
no record of his presence.</p>

<p>A curious medallion in the south transept shows
Salome dancing before Herod, not in the languorous
Oriental fashion one would have expected of her,
but turning a somersault worthy of the music-hall
stage, with a lavish display of red stockings.
A similar treatment of the subject occurs at
Bourges, and also in sculpture over one of the
west doors at Rouen Cathedral.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The north
rose.</p>

<p>The north rose still retains about three-quarters
of its original glazing, and enables one to make out
the design. In the centre is Christ, and in the
four petal-like lights which surround Him are, or
were, figures of the Blessed seated, not in circles but
in horizontal rows. Filling the spandrils between
these lights are four trefoils, of which two still each
contain an angel swinging a censer, in an attitude
ingeniously fitted to the shape of the light. Outside
these, sixteen circular lights form a ring round
the whole, and once represented the Second Coming
of Christ. At the top is Christ seated on the rainbow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
and in two lights on either side of Him are
angels carrying instruments of the Passion. Next
come St. Peter and the other Apostles, six in one
light on each side, and below them, in the lights
level with the centre, are the four archangels
sounding trumpets. The lower half of the circle
was probably devoted to the resurrection of the
dead and perhaps their judgment, but of these only
one light remains, showing the dead rising from
their graves, the rest being filled with single figures
from elsewhere.</p>

<p>The spandrils between these circles are filled
with little triangular lights forming an inner and
an outer ring of sixteen each. Of these the inner
ring is filled with white wavy pointed stars on a
red ground and the outer with similar red stars on
a dark blue ground, thus suggesting the idea&mdash;in
<i>colour</i> alone, without use of light or shade, of light
and warmth radiating from the centre.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>According to Mr. Westlake the central Christ
has no stigmata, while the one in the outer circle
has them; but the painting has now perished too
much for me to see this even at close quarters.
His theory is that the centre represents Christ as
"The Word,&mdash;the uncreated Wisdom, as Creator,
resting,"&mdash;and the outer circle shows His last coming
as Judge.

<h2 class="p6">VI<br />

THIRTEENTH CENTURY GLASS<br />
IN FRANCE<br />
<br />
(SENS AND CHARTRES)</h2>

<p class="sidenote">Sens.</p>

<p>It was at Sens that Thomas à Becket took refuge
during his exile. His mitre and chasuble are still
preserved there, and the connection between the
two places seems to have remained very intimate.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that William of Sens was
the first architect of the choir of Canterbury, and
it is not surprising to find the resemblance between
the cathedrals at the two places very marked
indeed. Not only does one at once perceive the
same hand in the architecture, but what remains of
the early glass at Sens is quite incontestably the
work of the same artist who gave us the east
window and the Jordan Fitzeisulf window at
Canterbury.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Good
Samaritan.</p>

<p>There are four of these windows at Sens, all in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
the north choir aisle. They have suffered a little
from restoration but not very much. Their subjects
respectively from left to right are, the Life and Death
of St. Thomas à Becket, the Story of St. Eustace,
the Parable of the Prodigal Son, and the Parable of
the Good Samaritan. This last is another "type
and antitype" window, and corresponds exactly in
the arrangement of its subjects with one of the lost
windows in the choir of Canterbury as described in
the manuscript catalogue before mentioned. The
verses, however, which were in the Canterbury
window are omitted at Sens. To the mediæval mind
the parable of the Good Samaritan was much more
than a mere illustration of "neighbourliness." To
them the "man who went down from Jerusalem"&mdash;the
City of God&mdash;"to Jericho," was Adam
leaving Paradise, the thieves were the seven deadly
sins, the Priest and the Levite were the law of
Moses, and the Good Samaritan was Christ Himself.
It is this reading of the subject which is here
illustrated. From the fact that at Sens it is
isolated, while at Canterbury it was, as we have
seen, one of a series, I think we may conclude that
Sens is the later of the two. The drawing of the
medallions resembles that of the older work at
Canterbury, whereas the setting of them is a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
later in character, showing the beginnings of
"mosaic diaper." It seems to me probable, therefore,
that for the subjects the actual drawings from
Canterbury were used in a fresh setting. We know
from the Treatise of Theophilus that designs for
windows at this time were drawn out in full size on
whitened boards, which also served apparently as
the bench on which the window was put together.
Not much would be left of the drawing when the
window was finished, and the bench would be re-whitewashed
for the next window; but from the
fact that similar treatments of the same subject
repeatedly occur, it seems to me not unlikely that
drawings of figure subjects for medallions were kept
on separate sheets of parchment, or in a book, and
used again.</p>

<p class="caption">PLATE XV<br />
THE FLIGHT INTO EGYPT, POITIERS<br />
Late Thirteenth Century</p>
</div>

<p>To the scene of the Good Samaritan rescuing
the traveller there are four scenes showing as a
"type" the Passion of Christ. Of these the
Crucifixion is treated in the most striking and
original way, which I rather think occurs also at
Bourges. On one side of the cross stands a female
figure wearing a crown and with a nimbus, and
receiving in a chalice the blood which flows from
the side of Christ; on the other, a six-winged
seraph is sheathing a sword. The latter is, no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
doubt, a symbol of the peace made between God
and man by the atonement on the Cross,&mdash;I think
PP. Cahier and Martin identify him with the
angel that guarded the gates of Paradise,&mdash;while
the crowned female figure is, of course, the
Church.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Prodigal
Son.</p>

<p>The next window, containing the Parable of the
Prodigal Son, differs from the others in having
straight iron-work and a more formal arrangement
of the medallions. I do not think, however, that
it is older. One charming panel in it is a good
illustration of the attitude of the artists of that day
on the question of colour. The Prodigal Son is
feeding pigs, of which one is white, two blue, one
green, and one red! The next scene shows him
making his way homeward, undeterred by the
efforts to hamper him of several devils as gaily and
variously coloured as the pigs. There is considerable
dramatic power shown in this figure of the
Prodigal. Let no one call the drawing of this
period <i>bad</i> drawing. It would be as true to call
Japanese drawing "bad." It is drawing in a
convention&mdash;a convention different from our own,
but which, once mastered, set the artist free to
express action and emotion without being further
hampered by technical difficulties.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">The Becket
window.</p>

<p>Of the other two, the one dealing with the
story of St. Thomas à Becket is the one which
most reminds me of Canterbury. Here there is
no doubt that we have the same hand that gave us
the Jordan Fitzeisulf window there. The border
is identical,&mdash;an unusual thing at that time even
in the same church,&mdash;and the representation of
Becket's tomb in the crypt is precisely the same.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The story of
St. Eustace.</p>

<p>I am less certain about the St. Eustace window.
Its general effect is very different from the others,
being flatter and less sparkling; but this may be
due to the work of a restorer. The figures,
however, do not fit and decorate the medallions as
well as in the other windows or in those at
Canterbury; in many cases part of a figure has to
project into the border.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The medallions themselves,
too, are of rather awkward shapes, and the
design of the iron-work not very restful. The
scroll work, however, is very like that in the east
window at Canterbury&mdash;so like that one can hardly
doubt their common origin. It may be that here,
too, the artist has used some one else's figure
designs, less successfully than in the Good Samaritan
window.</p>

<p>There is a Life of St. Eustace at Chartres in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
which the scenes bear a general resemblance to
those at Sens, but decorate their spaces much better.</p>

<p>To sum up, I think that these windows at Sens,
with the possible exception of the Life of St.
Eustace, are the work of the same artist as the
Jordan Fitzeisulf window and the east window in
"Becket's Crown" at Canterbury; that in the
Good Samaritan window he was using the cartoons
of his master, who designed the windows in
Canterbury choir, of which two, as we have seen,
remain. He may have come from Canterbury at
the time of the interdict in King John's reign
(1208-1213), when all work there must have been
suspended, and not returned, leaving another to
finish the work after the interdict was removed.
It would be a very probable date for the Sens
work, but in the absence of the destroyed windows
at Canterbury it is pure conjecture.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Chartres.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, ever since the fire in 1194, the
people of Chartres, careless of their personal losses,
had been working in a flame of enthusiasm and
devotion at the rebuilding of their Cathedral.
Every one, nobles, merchants, craftsmen, and
peasants, gave what they could. Some gave money,
some materials, some provisions for the workmen.
Those who had nothing else gave their labour, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
harnessing themselves to carts to drag stone for the
building. Heaven itself seemed to lend its aid,
for it is said that Our Lady worked many miracles
of healing at her shrine at Chartres, which soon
became a thirteenth century Lourdes, to which
pilgrims came from all countries, leaving offerings
of money or jewels.</p>

<p>Finally, in 1210 the main part of the building
seems to have been finished. "Entirely rebuilt in
hewn stone," says William le Breton some years
later, "the Cathedral of Chartres has nothing to
fear from temporal fire from now till the day of
judgment, and will save from eternal fire the many
Christians who by their alms have contributed to
its reconstruction."</p>

<p>The great church was now ready to receive its
decoration: The altars, the painting, the sculpture
were still to be done, and above all the one hundred
and twenty-five great windows, with the three
great roses, and forty-seven lesser ones had to be
filled with the glass which still makes Chartres
Cathedral one of the wonders of the world. In the
year 1226 Saint Louis came to the throne. Eight
years later he acquired the Comté of Chartres, and
lent his powerful aid to the work, giving the great
rose window in the north transept and the five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
lancets below it, as well as other windows. The
King of Castile gave a window too, and following
these royal donors a crowd of princes, seigneurs,
and churchmen added their gifts, while forty-seven
windows were given by the Guilds of Chartres alone.
Yet even so it was thirty years more before the
bulk of the work was completed, and the actual
consecration did not take place, for some reason,
till October 17, 1260, when it was performed with
great pomp and rejoicing before Saint Louis and
his family and an immense concourse of prelates,
nobles, and common people.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the world quite like the
Cathedral of Chartres. In the quality of its work
Canterbury is as good or even better, but for the
proper appreciation of the glass of the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries it is necessary to have <i>every</i>
window of the building filled with it in order that
the eye may get used to the gloom and attuned to
the pitch of the colour; and it is only at Chartres
that this is even approximately the case. I know
nothing like the effect on one of several hours
spent in the building, the awe and wonder, mingled
with a strange sort of exaltation, which it produces.</p>

<p>Even when its windows were complete, Canterbury
can hardly have had quite the same effect, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
its clerestory is much smaller, and it has not the
splendid width of nave and choir which enables
one to see the great clerestory windows of Chartres
so well. In the thirteenth century the nave at
Canterbury was still the old Norman nave of
Lanfranc, of which the windows were, as an old
drawing shows, comparatively small; nor indeed
do we know for certain if they had coloured glass
in them.</p>

<p>York is almost as complete as Chartres, but the
glass there is nearly all of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, and though it is in a sense quite
as beautiful, with all its great windows twinkling
with lovely colour, yet the subjects are too small
to be seen from below, and there is nothing like
the awe-inspiring majesty of the ranks of colossal
saints which fill the clerestory of Chartres.</p>

<p>That the master or masters of Canterbury and
Sens came to Chartres is, I think, certain; the
Canterbury tradition is traceable in so much of the
work. Here I imagine he or they ended their life's
work, leaving their pupils and their pupils' successors
to carry it on in the later style which they developed
as they went along. One of these, no doubt, was
that Clement of Chartres who signed his name in
the window at Rouen which Mr. Saint has sketched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
in <a href="#i149">Plate XIV.</a> I think I can trace his hand in
some of the windows on the south side of the nave
at Chartres, in the treatment of the mosaic diaper
in which various shades of blue have been so
skilfully blended as to produce, as at Rouen, a lovely
play and ripple of colour over the whole surface of
the window.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most notable development of the
style at Chartres is the increase in the use of mosaic
diaper, of the kind illustrated in <a href="#i093">Plate VIII.</a>, as
a setting for the medallions, instead of the leafy
scroll work formerly used.</p>

<p>At Canterbury the mosaic diaper setting is the
exception, only occurring in one window; at Sens
it is introduced tentatively, but at Chartres it is
the rule. The scroll-work filling only occurs, I
think, in three windows of the lower tier. One
of these is the St. Eustace window already
mentioned, which to me is strongly reminiscent
of Canterbury work&mdash;more so, indeed, as far as
the medallions go, than the similar one at Sens.</p>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">The four
ex&shy;tremities.</p>

<p>It is only at the four extremities of the
Cathedral at Chartres that we find any connected
idea governing the choice of subjects. The three
twelfth century windows were already, as I have
said, devoted to the ancestry and life of Christ,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
and the thirteenth century rose window above them
shows His second coming. The seven great lancets
of the apse are given up to the glorification of the
Virgin, the especial patroness of Chartres. The
north rose and the lights below it seem to show
the human ancestry of Christ culminating in Saint
Anne and the Virgin, while opposite in the south
transept is the Christ of the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>In other parts of the church the choice of
theme seems to have been left to the taste of the
donors, subject only to the general arrangement
of medallion windows in the lower tier and huge
single figures in the clerestory lights. Thus in the
lower windows we find the story of Noah next to
that of St. Lubin, Bishop of Chartres; the story of
St. Eustace next that of Joseph.</p>

<p>One or two of the clerestory windows are
medallion windows, the medallions being on a
very large scale, but most of them are filled, as
I say, with single figures of saints, nearly twice
life-size. So large are they that their faces have
had to be composed of several pieces of glass. A
brownish pink is used for the flesh, and the eyes
are separate pieces of white with the pupil painted
in. As the flesh colour has in many cases darkened
considerably from the effects of time and weather,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
the effect of the brilliant whites of the eyes is
somewhat weird and startling.</p>

<p>Here again there seems to be no special idea
governing the order of subjects, which were probably
left to the donors, who would choose their
patron saints.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Guild
windows.</p>

<p>It is at Chartres that for the first time, as I
believe, the donors of the windows are made much
account of in the glass. It is true that at St.
Denis there are two very tiny figures of Abbot
Suger,&mdash;in one case, prostrate, in simple monk's
dress, at the feet of the Virgin in the Annunciation,
and in the other, holding up a model of the Jesse
window,&mdash;and there is a donor at Poitiers, but at
Canterbury and Sens there is nothing to show by
whom the windows were given. At Chartres, however,
it is far otherwise. Partly, perhaps, because
of the emulation that had been shown in presenting
windows, nearly every one contains some record
of its donor. In the case of those given by the
Guilds this takes the form of a little panel introduced
into the bottom of the window, showing
members of the Guild at work&mdash;bakers, butchers,
tanners, furriers, money-changers and so on&mdash;charming
and valuable little pictures of the everyday
life of the time. More noble donors are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
represented by their portraits, either kneeling at
the foot of the window or, as in the clerestory of
the choir, where the rose-lights of the tracery are
filled with a splendid series of princes and nobles
armed and on horseback, each recognizable by his
shield and banner.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Amaury de
Montfort.</p>

<p>The one illustrated in Mr. Saint's sketch in
<a href="#i133">Plate XII.</a> is Amaury de Montfort, brother of
our own Simon de Montfort who led the
rebellion of the barons against Henry III., and
son of that Simon de Montfort who led the
crusade against the Albigenses and was made
Lord of Languedoc for his pains. Amaury, who
succeeded him in 1218, finding himself not strong
enough to hold the country, had ceded his rights
six years later to the King of France, and was made
in return Constable of France.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Pierre
Mauclerc.</p>

<p>The great rose window of the south transept
and the lancets below it are the gift of Pierre
Mauclerc, Count of Dreux and Duke of Brittany.
His arms are in the trefoils of the rose and in the
central lancet. At the foot of the lancets on either
side are portraits of himself, his wife, Alix de
Thouars, and his son and daughter, all kneeling.
From the fact that his wife died in 1226 it has
been argued that the window must have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
executed, or at least designed, before that date. I
do not know that the argument is absolutely
conclusive, but the fact seems probable. The
window, however, cannot be many years older than
this date. The choir would almost certainly be
the first part of the church to be glazed, and the
windows in the clerestory there were certainly not
finished till after 1220. One, indeed, has the figure
of a king of France on horseback as donor, who has
always been called St. Louis. It is, however, quite
possible, as far as I can see, that the figure is his
father, Louis VIII., or even Philip Augustus, who
died in 1223, for he bears the lilies of France only,
without the castle of Castile.</p>

<p class="sidenote">St. Louis.</p>

<p>Assuming therefore that the date of the south
rose is shortly before 1226, then Pierre Mauclerc, at
the time he gave this and the other windows in the
church which bear his arms, was practically an
independent sovereign. When St. Louis ascended
the throne as a boy in 1226, under the Regency of
his mother, the wise and beautiful, if somewhat
imperious, Blanche of Castile, Pierre Mauclerc, in
company with Thibault of Champagne, who was
Count of Chartres, and many other barons of
France, took up arms against his sovereign,
scorning to acknowledge the overlordship of a boy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
and a woman. Eight years later the boy and the
woman, aided by the devoted support of the
Commons, had brought them all to submission, and
Thibault had yielded up Chartres to the Crown.
It seems to me not unlikely that this latter event
is marked by the gift of the north rose and the
lancets below, which contain St. Louis's own arms
and those of his mother. If so, the glass of
Chartres may be considered as a landmark in the
history of the growth of France into a nation.
Whether this is so or not, the north rose cannot
in any case be earlier than 1226, the year of St.
Louis's accession.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The north
rose and
lancets.</p>

<p>This north rose, or Rose of France as it is
called, has in its centre light the Virgin with the
Child, in a purple tunic with a blue robe and nimbus
against a ground of rich ruby. In the twelve
radiating lights round her are: above her head, four
doves; on her right and left, four angels,&mdash;two on
either side,&mdash;two incensing and two holding candles;
and below, four six-winged seraphs. Outside these
are twelve kings of Judah, the Virgin's ancestors,
and outside these again is a ring of the Prophets
who foretold Christ's coming. Below, in the five
great lancets, is a huge figure of Saint Anne carrying
the infant Virgin, having on her right King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
David and on her left Solomon, and beyond these
Melchizedek and Aaron, types of Christ as King
and High Priest. Below St. Anne is a great shield
with the arms of St. Louis, but under each of the
four other figures is a kind of "predella," in which
are shown, as a contrast: below David, Saul falling on
his sword; below Solomon, Jeroboam worshipping
the golden calves; below Melchizedek, Nebuchadnezzar;
and below Aaron, Pharaoh being whirled
away, horse and man, in the Red Sea. In this last
scene the artist has been in a dilemma. The backgrounds
of these lancets are alternately red and
blue, and Pharaoh's should have been blue, but it
represents the <i>Red</i> Sea, and the artist has had to
get out of the difficulty by making it a kind of
maroon purple.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The south
rose and
lancets.</p>

<p>The idea of the window is the same as that of
Jesse Tree: Humanity preparing, through the
ages, for the coming of Christ, and culminating in
His Mother. The rose and lancets opposite show
the fulfilment. Here Christ is seen enthroned in
the centre of the rose, as St. John beheld Him,
surrounded by angels and by the four great beasts,
and by the four-and-twenty elders seated on their
thrones, in a double ring round the whole.</p>

<p>In the five lancets below are, in the centre,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the Virgin and Child, and on either side the four
Evangelists, borne, by a quaint conceit, like children
on the strong shoulders of the major Prophets.
The general arrangement of the windows is the
same, but the detail seems to me to bear out the
supposition that the southern rose is by some years
the earlier of the two. In both windows the outer
and the inner ring of figures are contained in circular
medallions, but where in the south rose the "filling
in" is done by means of scroll work, in the north
transept "mosaic diaper" is everywhere used.
The borders of the lancets, too, are of an older
type, and more beautiful in the south transept than
in the north.</p>

<p>Both, however, are very lovely, and the more
I look at them the more I admire the nameless
workers who could so use red and blue&mdash;such
difficult colours to combine well. For red and
blue are everywhere the groundwork of the colour
scheme&mdash;green, purple, brown, and yellow being
only used in small quantities to relieve them. It
must be remembered, too, that the artist <i>could
never see the effect of his work till it was finished</i>.
Nowadays the stained-glass painter can put his
work together temporarily by fastening it with beeswax
to a large sheet of white glass, and can work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
on it so; but the artist of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, as we know from Theophilus, and as was
probably the case for long after, did all his work
"on the bench." The most he could do would be
to hold a few pieces together in his hands up to
the light, but for the rest he had to trust to his
experience and training.</p>

<p>Not quite always did he succeed. Much
depended upon his getting just the right quality
of blue, and sometimes this seems to have failed
him. I have already noticed the rather purplish
blue which is found in some of the windows at
Lincoln, and this occurs again at Chartres in the
central lancet of the apse, and the one next it on
the north containing the big angel illustrated in
<a href="#i113">Plate X.</a> This purplish blue when interspersed
with red produces at a distance the effect of
a rather unpleasant mauve, making these two
windows less attractive in colour than the others.
This purplish blue occurs again in the north rose
of Notre Dame at Paris, but there the artist has
countered it by the use of a good deal of a rather
sharp pale green, which completely balances it and
turns the window into perhaps the most glorious
of all the great rose windows of France.</p>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">The apse.</p>

<p>Five of the seven great lancets of the clerestory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
of the apse are devoted to the glorification of the
Virgin Mother, or perhaps one should say, to
the fact of the Virgin Birth. This is what one
would expect at Chartres. Not only is the church
dedicated to Notre Dame, but the place in the
Middle Ages was held sacred to her above all
others in France.</p>

<p>Tradition says that the Church occupies the site
of a grotto in which the Druids worshipped "the
Virgin that shall bear a child," of whom they had
set up a wooden image, which was preserved by
the Christians when the grotto became a Christian
church. Certain it is that down to the Revolution
a very ancient and quite black wooden statue was
worshipped in the Chapel of Notre Dame Sous-terre&mdash;the
ancient grotto&mdash;where it had been at
all events since the days of Fulbert, who built
the eleventh century Cathedral. The Sansculottes
burnt it, and its place has been taken by a modern
work which professes to be a copy of it.</p>

<p>Chartres, too, can boast of the possession of
the Holy Veil. Given to Charlemagne by the
Byzantine Emperor, Constantine Porphyrogenitus,
it has escaped successive fires, and though cut in
two at the Revolution, is still preserved in the
Treasury.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>Owing to the great height and narrowness of
the lancets, each contains several figures or figure
subjects, one above the other. In the head of the
central lancet is Our Lady enthroned, with her Child
on her knee, and below her are the Annunciation
and the Salutation. In the head of the light on either
side is an angel incensing, and in the lights beyond
these, a cherub and a seraph. Below these are Moses,
Aaron,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> David, and the four major Prophets&mdash;Isaiah,
Jeremiah, Ezekiel&mdash;and Daniel. The arrangement
of these figures seems, however, quite haphazard,
and as if the original design had not been
carried out. The two remaining lancets, on the
extreme right and left, contain, respectively, scenes
from the lives of St. John the Baptist and St. Peter.
How far these are meant to have a bearing on
the central subject I am not quite sure. The
uppermost subjects in them are the Baptism of
Christ and the "Domine, quo vadis?"</p>

<p class="sidenote">The big
angel.</p>

<p>The Big Angel (<a href="#i113">Plate X.</a>) on the north side of
the Virgin is especially puzzling. The other six
lights of the apse have each three figures or figure
subjects, set one above the other in elongated
medallions,&mdash;<a href="#i121">Plate XI.</a> shows two of them, King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
David and Ezekiel,&mdash;and at the foot of each is a
panel showing the donors. The other figures are
so set as to form regular tiers round the apse, but
this angel is twice the size of any of them and
forces the figure below&mdash;Aaron&mdash;down out of line,
leaving no room for another figure between him
and the donor.</p>

<p>Perhaps this light represents part of a design for
the apse which was afterwards modified in order to
get more figures in. The donor is one Gaufridus,
who has been identified with a certain Godfrey
d'Illiers, a gentleman of the neighbourhood, whereas
the rest are given by the Guilds&mdash;the bakers,
butchers, money-changers, and furriers, which
latter are seen actually bringing their window.</p>

<p>The Prophets bear a good deal of resemblance to
the figures from the clerestory at Canterbury. The
Isaiah at both places wears the same curious headdress&mdash;a
little round hat, not unlike the latest form
of "bowler" of our own days. The figures are not
from the same drawings, for the attitudes are
different, but the Chartres artist has at least
remembered Canterbury choir, which was probably
the work of his master, thirty or forty years earlier.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The canopy.</p>

<p>Notice the simple architectural canopy over this
angel. All the single figures at Chartres and in most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
other thirteenth century windows have them, and
their counterparts may be found in the canopies
over the sculptured figures on the porches outside.
They occur also at Canterbury over some of the
surviving figures from the clerestory, but it is noteworthy
that whereas at Canterbury the canopies
are round arched (and the same is true of the
architecture in the medallion windows), at Chartres
they are nearly all either cusped or pointed, which
I take as additional evidence in support of my
opinion that the Canterbury work is the older of
the two.</p>

period they were destined, as we shall see later, to
be developed out of all reason or proportion.

OTHER THIRTEENTH CENTURY<br />
WINDOWS</h2>

<p class="sidenote">Salis&shy;bury
and Peter&shy;borough.</p>

<p>A single band of craftsmen might, as far as we
can now tell, have been responsible for nearly all
the stained glass that was produced at any one
time in the twelfth century in England and the
north of France; but by the time the Trinity Chapel
at Canterbury was finished, a great many such
bands must have been at work, yet all deriving
their art from the same source&mdash;the school of
Chartres, St. Denis, and Canterbury. The output
was enormous, especially in the first half of the
thirteenth century. I have already spoken of
Lincoln, but Salisbury and Peterborough were
once rich in glass of the thirteenth century, that of
Peterborough&mdash;now destroyed&mdash;being known to
have been given, some of it at least, as early as
1214, and York has the famous "Five Sisters."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Bourges.</p>

<p>In France, Bourges is only second to Chartres
for the quantity and interest of its early glass, which
was certainly begun long before the windows of
Chartres were finished. Every one knows the rose
windows of Notre Dame at Paris, and besides these
Amiens, Beauvais, Laon, Rheims, Tours, Soissons,
Auxerre, and in fact nearly all the great cathedrals
of France, contain glass of the period, while fragments
of it are to be found in many parish churches
both in England and France.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Westwell.</p>

<p>At Westwell in Kent, for instance, is a Jesse Tree
of 1240-1250 which is well worth study, in which
the details of the foliage resemble fragments of one
at Salisbury and another at Troyes, and show the
development that had taken place from the Jesse
Trees of Chartres and St. Denis.</p>

<p>It is impossible, however, in the limits of this
work to describe even all the important windows
of this period, and I have taken those I have
already described as typical of their time and as
together showing the progress of the development
of the art.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i205" id="i205"></a>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">The Sainte
Chapelle.</p>

<p>The most complete example of the work of the
latter part of the thirteenth century is the Sainte
Chapelle in Paris, built by St. Louis to contain the
Crown of Thorns, which he had purchased with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
other relics from the Emperor of Constantinople, who
was then in need of ready money. The Chapel was
consecrated in 1248, but although some at least of
the windows are said to have been prepared beforehand
and to have been in their place on that
occasion, yet the series was certainly not completed
till after the death of St. Louis in 1270, as that
event is represented in one of them.</p>

<p>The glass has unfortunately suffered a good
deal from restoration, and it is difficult now to say
quite how much beauty it once had, but it must be
confessed that at present it gives one none of the
joy and wonder of Chartres. Yet the very design
of the Chapel shows the importance which the art
had now attained, for the building is constructed
entirely with a view to being filled with stained
glass, being in fact a mere glass-house with no wall
spaces at all. If the colour effect may be judged
of from the specimens of the original glass now in
South Kensington Museum, the place must have
been a wondrous Aladdin's cave of jewels, but at
the same time it may be doubted whether the
arrangement was a wise one. The windows at
Chartres gain immensely by the spaces of gloom
between them, whereas here the eye gets no rest.</p>

<p>In detail, apart from colour, the work shows a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
certain falling off. The artist seems to have been
cramped by the necessity of adapting the medallion
window to such narrow lights. One misses the fine
broad border which does so much to "pull together"
the earlier medallion windows. The borders at the
Sainte Chapelle are narrow and uninteresting, and even
so the medallions have sometimes to overlap them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Work of
Clement of
Chartres
at Rouen.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the work of Clement of
Chartres in Rouen Cathedral, which is as late as
1290-1295, is as good as anything that was done
in the thirteenth century. Besides a great many
broken remains of thirteenth century work in the
nave, there are five complete windows in the
ambulatory of the apse. Two of these between
them illustrate the story of Joseph, and are
particularly beautiful. One of them (<a href="#i149">Plate XIV.</a>)
is signed by Clement of Chartres, and the other
is obviously by the same hand. I should hesitate,
however, to say positively that the other three are
his work too, but I think two of them may be. Of
these, one contains in its lowest section the story
of the Good Samaritan, with other subjects above
which I have not identified, and the other&mdash;a very
good one&mdash;the story of St. Julian, which is a parallel
to that of &OElig;dipus except that, being Christian, it
ends with atonement and forgiveness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>The fifth window illustrates the Passion, Resurrection,
and Ascension of Christ. It is hardly
as good as the others, and is very red and hot in
general colour. The filling in, of yellow suns on
a blue ground, is very unlike any other thirteenth
century work. On the whole this window seems to
me to show a certain restlessness, indicative of the
change of style that was so soon to follow. The
redness, however, may perhaps be intentional, as
being appropriate to the subject, for of the three
twelfth century windows in the west end of
Chartres Cathedral, the one which illustrates the
Passion is far redder than the others.</p>

<p>The iron-work of these windows shows a return
to the straight-bar system, but the relation of the
medallions to the iron-work is, as may be seen by
the illustration, wholly different to what it was in
the twelfth century. By the end of the thirteenth
century the bent iron-work has wholly disappeared.</p>

<p>Before leaving the Early Period I must touch
upon another of its developments, namely, the
grisaille window.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Grisaille
windows.</p>

<p>Side by side with the richly coloured windows
which we have been considering, there had grown
up during the thirteenth century a style of window
in which a wholly different effect was aimed at.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
These are what are called grisaille windows, in
which the bulk of the glass is white, only studded
here and there with jewels of colour and with,
perhaps, a coloured border, the surface of the white
glass being variegated and ornamented with delicate
patterns in painted line work. The effect of this
in old glass is very beautiful,&mdash;there are few things
lovelier than "the Five Sisters" at York,&mdash;but all
modern attempts to imitate it have been hopeless
failures, looking like so much transparent paper.
Perhaps our modern white glass is too clear and
hard-looking, or the difference may be merely that
between the work of those who are artists and those
who are not.</p>

<p>The causes which led to the development of this
style of window were probably two: one, the desire
for more light, of which the richly coloured windows
admitted but little; and the other, simply economy,
for a window of this sort could be produced
comparatively cheaply. Then, too, the Cistercians,
whose rule, adopted in the twelfth century, prohibited
the use of colour altogether, had shown
what could be done in patterns of white glass and
lead alone.</p>

<p>Unless you count the "gryphon windows" in
St. Denis, which are mainly the work of Viollet-le-Duc,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
grisaille seems almost wholly a development
of the thirteenth century. It is interesting to see
that just as the design of the coloured window
seems always to have been conceived as a light
pattern on a dark ground, so the earliest grisaille,
even though the quantity of white far exceeds the
colour, still seems to have been conceived as a white
pattern on a coloured ground, the ground being, as
it were, almost entirely hidden by the pattern.
Later this idea gets reversed, and the coloured
pieces are mere jewels or lines contained in the
pattern.</p>

<p>In a white window the leads, from their greater
thickness, are more conspicuous than the traced lines
of the painting, and in consequence it is upon the
leads that the artist depends for the main features
of his design. The earliest grisaille windows may
be divided into two classes: those in which the
pattern is formed of narrow "straps" of white
glass interlacing or seeming to interlace; and the
other in which the leads form a flat geometrical
pattern, as at Lincoln. The painted pattern on the
glass consists of branching scroll work in simple
outline, forming stems and the round-lobed leaves
which were the thirteenth century convention for
foliage. In the earlier work the ground is covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
with delicate cross-hatching, which at a distance
resolves itself into a pearly grey, against which the
scroll work stands out white. At first, too, the
painted pattern is, so to speak, contained within the
leading, and merely enriches and emphasizes the
pattern formed by it; but in later work, towards
the end of the century, it becomes independent of
the leading and grows through it, spreading over
the surface of the window in graceful curves like
a creeper over a trellis. The influence of the
medallion window is often seen in contemporary
grisaille, of which the design frequently consists
of interlacing medallions of strap-work of the same
shape as those in the coloured windows.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rheims.<br />

<br />Angers,
Soissons, and
Chartres.</p>

<p>The ornament surrounding some of the figures
in the triforium of St. Remi at Rheims, and which
Mr. Westlake considers to date from about 1200,
contains so much colour as to be hardly grisaille,
and the same may be said of one of the lancets
in the north transept of Lincoln Cathedral, of
which the others contain grisaille of a later date.
There is, however, some very early thirteenth
century grisaille&mdash;true grisaille, with interlacing
bands&mdash;at St. Serge at Angers, and some at
Soissons of about 1230. Chartres has four or five grisaille
windows, of the middle of the century or a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
earlier, in the apsidal chapels. These have broad,
richly coloured borders, a very beautiful feature,
which one finds also at Salisbury.</p>

<p class="sidenote">West&shy;minster
Abbey.</p>

<p>According to Professor Lethaby<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the original
glazing of Westminster Abbey, begun in 1253, was,
at least in the lower windows, of grisaille, of which
some remains are in the triforium. From the
fabric rolls we know the name of the master-glazier,
Lawrence, presumably an Englishman, and
the weekly accounts show wages paid to fourteen
glaziers in all.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Salisbury.</p>

<p>The few remains of old glass which that
eighteenth century vandal, the architect Wyatt, has
left us at Salisbury include some very beautiful
and interesting specimens of thirteenth century
grisaille, of which the date is, according to Winston,
from 1240 to 1270. In most of these the pattern
when analysed is found to be formed of overlapping
(not interlacing) geometrical forms outlined
in bands of colour and filled in with white,
painted with patterns of the usual conventional
scroll work on a cross-hatched ground. There are
besides, however, some remains of ornamental
glazing of an interesting and rare kind in which
there is no painting whatever, and the pattern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
is obtained by lead-work alone, forming diagonal
white bands interlacing in various ways on a white
ground, and containing here and there between them
little square dies of blue. Some coloured tracings
of these may be seen in South Kensington Museum.</p>

<p class="sidenote">"The Five
Sisters" of
York.</p>

<p>The finest grisaille windows in England or, for
that matter, in the world, are the five immense
lancets which fill the end of the north transept of
York Minster and are known as "the Five Sisters."
Their date is probably about 1260. The iron-work
in them is straight-barred, and the massive
main bars, placed every 3½ feet or so, divide the
space between the broad borders into a succession
of squares, one above the other, each one of
which is occupied by a medallion&mdash;a different
shape in each light&mdash;outlined with a narrow band
of colour, and having bosses of colour at the centre
and between the medallions. One hardly can
trace the plan of the painted pattern on the white,
which besides is much confused with centuries of
breakage and repair, and one is only conscious of it
as texture, which indeed is its <i>raison d'être</i>. Five
feet wide, and towering to a height of more than
50 feet, each "sister" is a shimmering mass of pearl
and silver, delicately veined and jewelled with
colour to give quality to its whiteness.

<p class="sidenote">"Quarries."</p>

<p>The same tendency that caused the artist to substitute
mosaic diaper for the scroll work in the
setting of his medallions in coloured windows led
him in time to fill large spaces of his grisaille windows
with painted "quarries." "Quarries" (from the
French <i>carré</i>) are small diamond-shaped panes, and
were then the quickest and most economical way of
glazing any given space. Sometimes towards the
end of the century the painted pattern ran over
the quarries independently of them, but more often
in the thirteenth century each quarry was a repetition
of the next, the whole thus forming a regular
diaper. Sometimes each quarry has a thick black
line painted parallel to two, or sometimes all four,
of its sides at a distance of three quarters of an inch
or so, leaving the space between it and the lead
blank while the rest of the quarry is patterned. The
effect of this when glazed together is that of interlacing
white bands on a ground of pattern.</p>

<p>Apart from economy, the principal motive for
the use of grisaille in windows was, as I have said,
the need for light. In the Cathedral of Chartres,
where there is no grisaille except that in the
chapels already mentioned, and where practically
all the other windows are filled with richly coloured
glass, it is quite difficult to read in the nave on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
dull day. It is possible, therefore, that in some
churches a certain number of windows may have
been deliberately reserved for grisaille.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Com&shy;bination
of grisaille
and figure
work.</p>

<p>It is not, however, till the very end of the
thirteenth century, and then only rarely, that
coloured figures and grisaille were combined in
the same light as shown in the example from
Poitiers in <a href="#i161">Plate XV.</a>, though this is a salient
feature of the style of the succeeding period. In
the clerestory windows of the choir of St. Pierre
at Chartres, which belong to the closing years of
the century, the problem has been attacked in an
interesting and unique manner, but as the glass
in that church really marks the transition to the
succeeding period, I shall deal with it later.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Conclusion
of the Early
Period.</p>

<p>I must now leave the Early Period. If I have
devoted a larger space to it than I have to give to
either of those succeeding, it is because to me it
is the most interesting of all. In all later work
artists seem, by comparison, unsatisfied and trying,
sometimes with more, sometimes with less, success,
to reconcile opposing ideals in their work. Never
again does one find the same perfect understanding
of the limitations of the material, together with
such daring and grandeur of conception, and such
depth and earnestness in the ideas expressed.

<h2 class="p6">VIII<br />

THE STYLE OF THE SECOND PERIOD</h2>

<p>Although the earliest known work in the style
of the Second Period may possibly date from a
little before 1300, and although the transition
to the succeeding style had certainly begun by
1380, yet, roughly speaking, the limits of the
period are those of the fourteenth century, and it
is not unusual to speak loosely of the style as the
fourteenth century style in glass.</p>

<p>The interest of the period lies perhaps rather in
its tendencies and development than in its actual
achievements, which by general consent are inferior
not only to those of the First, but to those of the
Third, Period. It is a period of transition and
uncertainty, of the loss of old ideals when men
"follow wandering fires."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Weakening
of the
religious
motive.</p>

<p>Most of all does one notice the change of
mental attitude. The fierce missionary zeal for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
the Faith, the mystic symbolism, has gone. The
wonderful two hundred years which produced St.
Bernard, St. Francis, St. Dominic, St. Louis and
the Crusades, and which saw most of the great
cathedrals built are over, and a reaction sets in.
Never again do we find a whole people, from
princes to ploughmen, neglecting their personal
affairs and combining to build and decorate worthily
a glorious house of God. Churchmen are growing
comfortable and apathetic, if not corrupt, and
laymen are either uninterested in religion or
critical. Towards the end of the century this
feeling gives rise to Wyclif's movement and we
get <i>Piers Plowman</i>, with its fierce denunciation
of the means by which money was obtained for
windows and of "lordings" who "writen in
windowes of their well deedes."</p>

<p>With the religious motive thus weakened the
artist seems to have interested himself chiefly in
the technical side of his art,&mdash;he may even have
talked of "Art for Art's sake,"&mdash;and the usual
result follows. The lack of the underlying and
unifying motive produces a want of proportion in
the parts. The canopies become much more
important than the figures under them; narrative
subjects become much more rare, and when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
occur have none of the dramatic intensity of those
of the past age. Instead we have an endless series
of single figures of saints, without character and
each in exactly the same affected attitude, like an
elongated letter S. In search of inspiration the
artist turns to the study of nature and the literal
reproduction of plant forms in ornament. In the
figures too, although the attitudes are conventional
the drawing of drapery is less so, and towards the
end of the period the artist is tentatively feeling
his way towards modelling.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Progress in
technique.</p>

<p>One thing indeed we find during this time,
which is within the power of every artist in
times of artistic dearth, namely, a steady grappling
with practical problems offered by the changed
conditions, whereby the way was cleared for the
new life that came into the art in the succeeding
age. For instance, by showing how coloured figure
work could be combined with grisaille in the same
window they solved the problem of lighting; by the
invention of the silver stain they made it possible
to make white glass more interesting and to blend
it better with colour; while in drawing they made
steady progress towards a style more in keeping
with the standards of the time.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Charac&shy;teristics.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
iron-work.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The Simplification of the Iron-Work.</i>&mdash;The
windows of the twelfth century had been huge
single lights, but the thirteenth century had seen
the gradual evolution of tracery, beginning with the
grouping of lancets in pairs under a rose light above.
Gradually each lancet was again subdivided into
a pair of lights and a rose, the spandrils were
pierced, till, at the close of the century, the glazier
had to design his window to fit a row of narrow
lancets divided by slender mullions, which above
branched into an elaborate mass of tracery containing
a multitude of roses, quatrefoils, trefoils and little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
openings of all shapes and sizes. With this division
of the window into comparatively narrow lights the
need for the elaborate iron lattice of the preceding
age disappeared, its work being now largely taken
up by the stone-work. Instead of lights from six
to nine feet wide the glazier had now to deal with
lights three and a half feet wide at most, and often
much narrower, and in consequence all that was
necessary was a series of horizontal bars connecting
the mullions, which themselves take the place of
the upright bars of former days. In windows of
this time, then, and later, massive rebated bars are
fixed horizontally in the stone-work at intervals of
between three and four feet, and these with the
mullions really form the framework into the square
openings of which the panels of the glazing were
inserted separately. Between, and parallel with,
these massive bars, three or four light "saddle-bars"
are fixed on the inside of the glass, which
keep the panel in its place, the glass being attached
to them by means of strips of lead (called bands)
soldered to the lead-work of the glazing and twisted
round the bar. In order to distinguish between
the massive rebated bars which hold the top and
bottom of each panel and these light bars between,
I shall speak of the former as "frame-bars," the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
latter by the name they still hold, of "saddle-bars."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Tracery</p>

<p>The only change from this arrangement which
has been made in modern times (except for
the use of copper wire instead of lead for the
"bands") is the omission of the stout frame-bar,
the whole of the weight of the window being now
borne by its edges and the saddle-bars. Not only
is this arrangement less sound in construction but
it is also far less decorative. The thick bars at
intervals with thin bars between punctuate the
length of the tall windows pleasantly, and are made
use of in the design, which in this way is still based
on the iron-work. In a recent disastrous "restoration"
that was made of one of the windows in the
nave of York, the glass was refixed with saddle-bars
all of equal size and the thick frames omitted, and
it is wonderful how the eye misses them.</p>

<p>This arrangement was, of course, only used in
windows above a certain size, in quite small lights
the saddle-bars alone being considered sufficient. It
was not, I think, an uncommon arrangement for
the uppermost bar at all events&mdash;that at the
springing of the arch&mdash;to pass continuously through
all the mullions and bind them together.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Silver stain.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Invention of Silver Stain.</i>&mdash;In the early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
years of the fourteenth century an important
addition was made to the technical resources of the
glass painter by the discovery that if white glass
is painted with a preparation of silver&mdash;oxide or
chloride may be used, or even silver in its metallic
form, though that is less convenient&mdash;and then
subjected to the heat of the kiln, the parts so
painted will be found to be stained yellow, pale or
dark according to the amount of silver used and
according also to the composition of the glass.
This is a process quite different from enamelling.
It is a true <i>stain</i>, actually penetrating the glass to
a slight degree and quite indelible except by the
perishing of the glass itself. The oxide or chloride
of silver is only mixed with other substances, such
as yellow lake, for convenience of application.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Its first
appearance&shy;.</p>

<p>Precisely when and where the invention was
made and first used we have no means of knowing.
We may dismiss the story of the glazier from whose
coat a silver button dropped on to the glass he was
putting into the kiln, partly because the artist of
whom the story is told, one James of Ulm, who
worked in Italy and was beatified after his death,
was not born till more than a hundred years later.
It appears in York Minster, used very sparingly
and tentatively, soon after 1300. I am not sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
that there are any examples in France that can be
dated quite so early, but it was certainly used there
by 1310. Its first use was limited to such matters as
differentiating the hair, or gold crowns, of figures
from their faces, but the nave windows of York
Minster show a progressive increase in its use.
Yellow pot-metal is there still used for the larger
pieces of yellow in the canopy, but an examination
of the details in Plates <a href="#i177">XVII.</a>, <a href="#i189">XVIII.</a> will show
that stain is used in places to gild the crockets of
the white pinnacles, the beak and claws of the white
eagle in the border of <a href="#i177">XVII.c</a>, and the flowers in
the lower part of the border in <a href="#i177">XVII.a</a>. The pieces
that are yellow all over may, I think, be assumed to
be pot-metal. It is not, however, till one gets well
on in the century, to 1330 or 1340, that one finds
such a free use of the stain in the grisaille as that in
the windows at St. Ouen at Rouen, of which the
detail is given in Plates <a href="#i259">XXVI.</a>-<a href="#i295">XXX.</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">Combin&shy;ation
of figures
and grisaille.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The Combination of Figures and Grisaille.</i>&mdash;This
is one of the most noticeable developments
of the period. As I have said, it is occasionally
attempted in the preceding style towards the close
of the period, but in the fourteenth century it is
the rule. Small windows are sometimes still filled
entirely with colour, but nearly every window of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
any size, especially in the early part of the century,
contains a large proportion of grisaille. In the
nave of the Church of St. Pierre at Chartres (<a href="#i233">Plate XXIII.</a>)
the same principle is followed as in the
earlier work in the choir, namely, the arranging of
the figure-work and grisaille so as to form vertical
stripes of alternate white and colour. This plan,
however, was not persisted in. The numerous
vertical lines formed by the mullions in the newer
style of architecture required horizontal lines to
balance them, and accordingly we find the usual
method in fourteenth century windows is for the
coloured masses to be ranged in horizontal bands
running right across the window through all the
lights. <a href="#i253">Plate XXV.</a> from St. Ouen at Rouen
shows a very typical window of the period. Sometimes
there was, as here, one row of coloured
panels, sometimes two or more as in the nave of
York Minster. It will be noticed that in order to
blend the white and colour satisfactorily the designer
includes a good deal of white among the colour and
a good deal of colour among the white. This
latter is no longer dispersed through the white in
coloured threads, half suspected, but is collected
into bosses and borders where its effect is strong
enough to support the principal masses. In fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
the key-note of the design&mdash;namely, the strong
contrast of light and dark in flat masses,
necessitated by the combination of colour and
grisaille&mdash;is repeated everywhere in detail throughout
the window of which the parts are thus brought
into harmony with the whole.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The borders.</p>

<p>This same idea leads to a complete change in
the character of the borders. The running scroll
work of the preceding age would no longer be
appropriate; the vertical lines need breaking rather
than emphasizing, and the design of the border
usually takes the form of alternate blocks of colour
and white or yellow. <a href="#i275">Plate XXVIII.</a> shows some
typical borders from Rouen, borders typical of
English as well as French work. It will be noticed
that the coloured pieces are usually left blank while
the white and yellow are decorated with patterns
or foliage blocked out with solid black. The
ornament of the tracery lights, which by the way
are usually kept pretty full of colour, is designed
on the same principle. It consists, in fact, of
borders tightly curled up with, sometimes, in the
larger lights, a figure or a small coloured medallion
in the centre containing a head.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The bosses.</p>

<p>The intervals formed by the regular spacing of
the thick iron frame-bars are further emphasized by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
the placing of a coloured boss or small medallion
midway between each. This arrangement in some
form or other is almost universal in fourteenth
century grisaille, the panels contained between the
frame-bars being in fact the units of the design.
Some of these bosses from Rouen are shown in
Plates <a href="#i259">XXVI.</a>, <a href="#i267">XXVII.</a>, <a href="#i287">XXIX.</a> Here they are
purely fantastic in design, but elsewhere, as at York,
they frequently have an heraldic motive or even
take the form of shields of arms (<a href="#i189">Plate XVIII.</a>).
Heraldic motives are very commonly used too in
the borders, as may be seen in the details from York
Minster in <a href="#i177">Plate XVII.</a>, the charges from the shield
being repeated all up the border, relieved against,
or sometimes alternating with blocks of the
colour of the field. Symbolic objects such as
chalices are sometimes used in the same way, and
occasionally we find borders formed of a succession
of little figures under canopies, as in the very
elaborate example from York in <a href="#i189">Plate XVIII.</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">Quarries.</p>

<p>As the century proceeds quarries become much
the commonest form of grisaille. In Plates
<a href="#i253">XXV.</a>, <a href="#i259">XXVI.</a> they are true quarries, but in the
first quarter of the fourteenth century they are
sometimes, as, for instance, at York, "bulged"
round the central boss, thus forming a sort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
of cross between quarries and geometric glazing.
Grisaille glazed in geometric patterns such as we
find at Merton College, at Evreux, and in St.
Pierre at Chartres belongs, I think, always to quite
the early years of the period, and even then, as may
be seen in <a href="#i233">Plate XXIII.</a>, it shows a decided leaning
towards quarry-work, and indeed needs little
but the straightening of the leads to convert it
into quarries altogether.</p>

<p>Continuous painted patterns are now the rule,
as shown in <a href="#i259">Plate XXVI.</a> The cross-hatched
grounds disappear, and presently the silver stain is
used (as here) to enrich the painting. It will be
noticed that the trellis-like pattern produced by
painting lines parallel to the leading is still
retained.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The canopy.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The Extraordinary Development of the
Canopy.</i>&mdash;As we have seen, single figures in the
preceding period, even at Canterbury, usually had
architectural canopies of an unobtrusive kind, of
similar design to the sculptured niches which
sheltered the statues on the outside of the building.
The motive for their adoption by the glazier
at this date is not very obvious. They do not in
the Early Period form a very important feature
in the design, and serve no decorative purpose that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
the artist could not equally well have attained by
the flat ornamentation of which he was a master.
However, the glazier seems to have liked the idea
when he saw it in stone-work, where it had a
practical object, and to have imported it into
his own work, where it had none. It must be
remembered that when the sculpture was painted
in colours, as it was then, the resemblance between
it and the stained glass would have been closer
than it is now.</p>

<p>However this may be, the canopy in the
thirteenth century was a comparatively unobtrusive
object, but in the fourteenth century,
as the sculptured canopy grew and developed, so
did its counterpart in stained glass, till the stained-glass
worker seems to have run canopy mad.
Not only is it now found over single figures but
over subjects too.</p>

<p>It is true there was now a certain practical
reason for the tall canopy to be found in the
tall and narrow shape of the lights that had to
be filled. The human figure was very short and
broad in proportion to them, and when it was a
case of a group the resulting shape was shorter
still, so the canopy offered a convenient way of
elongating the design; but the fourteenth century
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
designer developed it, as may be seen in the illustrations,
out of all reason, filling it with fantastic
detail&mdash;angels looking out of the windows, birds
perching on the pinnacles, and miniature figures
standing like statues in the niches of it&mdash;till it
quite reduced the figures below it to insignificance.
In doing so he was only following the rest of the
artistic world, which had all gone wild over the
new style of architecture,&mdash;with its "passion of
pinnacle and fret," as Ruskin called it,&mdash;using its
details as motives for ornament even where they
were least appropriate; but all this expenditure
of effort on fantastic and irrelevant detail is really
a symptom of the weakening of interest in the
principal theme, of which a further sign is the
uninteresting treatment of the subjects themselves.</p>

<p>The fourteenth century canopy is, at first at
least, always in pure elevation, attempts at perspective
not being found till close on the end of
the century. <a href="#i253">Plate XXV.</a> shows both of the
forms which are most commonly found, that with
a single big crocketted gable and arch spanning
the opening, and that with three small ones. I
think the former is the earlier form, but they are
often, as here, found together.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The base.</p>

<p>In the earlier part of the century at all events,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
there is never an architectural base to the panel
as well as a canopy, but both subject and the
shafts of the canopy end off below with a straight
line at one of the frame-bars. The earliest examples
of anything in the nature of a base that I know
of are at Wells and in the great east window of
Gloucester Cathedral, where the topmost pinnacle
of each canopy spreads out into a sort of bracket
supporting the next figure above, while the shafts
at the side are prolonged upwards into the
canopy of that figure, an arrangement suggestive
of Perpendicular work. But indeed in its general
arrangement, though not in its details, the Gloucester
east window, though executed in 1350-1360,
contains many hints of the style that was to
follow, the stone tracery, in fact, being pure
Perpendicular, perhaps the earliest example known.</p>

<p>The canopy work itself is always in the main
yellow or white, relieved against a coloured background,
and with windows, capitals and other
details put in with another colour. In the aisle
windows of the nave of York Cathedral, the
coloured background, and, at first, the pinnacles of
the canopy too, end off square at the top, at one
of the frame-bars, just as the panel does at the
bottom. As the series proceeds, however, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
central pinnacles, as in the "Peter de Dene"
window, of which details are given in <a href="#i189">Plate XVIII.</a>,
are prolonged above the bar, a tendency which
became more and more developed as time went
on. In the big window from St. Ouen's at Rouen,
shown in <a href="#i253">Plate XXV.</a>, the coloured background,
by a rather inept arrangement, is also brought up
behind the pinnacles, and has to end in a somewhat
meaningless outline.</p>

<p>At first the yellow of the canopies was obtained
by the use of a yellow glass, a "pot-metal" (<i>i.e.</i> a
glass coloured all through in the making) of a not
very pleasant colour, but gradually this was superseded
by the use of silver stain, by means of
which a much lighter and more delicate effect
could be obtained. Its introduction was gradual,
however, the artist having to feel his way towards
the best use of it. As its use increased, coloured
glass was less and less used for details of the
canopy, the character of which gradually approached
more and more to that which it was to have in the
following period.</p>

<p>In some of the very earliest windows of the
period, such as those in Merton College Chapel and
in the chapels of the choir in Evreux Cathedral,
small coloured panels, with canopies of quite modest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
and reasonable proportions, are used to decorate
large spaces of grisaille. The growth of the
canopy began very soon, however, and where
these small canopies are found together with
geometric glazing of the grisaille and a complete
absence of silver stain, it is fairly safe to assign a
date to the window not much later than 1305.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Figures on
quarries.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, in spite of the fourteenth
century fondness for elaborate canopies, we find
at the same time another type of window in
which they are wholly absent, the figures being
placed simply upon a background of quarries.
<a href="#i243">Plate XXIV.</a>, one of a series from the clerestory
of St. Ouen at Rouen, is an example of this.
Here the figures stand, it is true, on little architectural
bases (an exception to the rule I mentioned
just now), but elsewhere these too are absent.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The S-like
pose.</p>

<p>(5) <i>The Style of Drawing the Figure.</i>&mdash;The
chief characteristic of this in fourteenth century
work is its apparent affectation. There seems
to have been a sudden revolt from the taste
for dramatic force of action which characterized
the subject panels of the thirteenth century.
Look at <a href="#i303">Plate XXXI.</a> from Rouen, with its
three little panels showing the Annunciation and
the Visitation. In each the figure is in exactly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
the same pose, and that a perfectly meaningless
one, like an elongated letter S. Yet this pose
seems to have become all the fashion, for it is
almost universal in the work of this period, and
is found even in such transitional work as the
east windows of the antechapel of New College,
Oxford, which, in other respects, belong far more
to the succeeding period.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of this loss of naturalism in movement,
in the actual drawing of forms, both of
the figure and of drapery, there is an advance.
If you will compare St. Luke from the clerestory
of St. Ouen at Rouen in <a href="#i243">Plate XXIV.</a>
with Methuselah from Canterbury in <a href="#i041">Plate III.</a>,
you will see the change that has occurred. St.
Luke has far less character and force, he is far
less alive, his pose and gesture mean nothing,
or at most are mildly argumentative, and yet
there is a certain sense in which he, and still
more his drapery, is better drawn, or if not better,
at all events in a more advanced manner. This
is more noticeable if you compare St. Luke or
the little figures in <a href="#i295">Plate XXX.</a> with the big
angel from Chartres in <a href="#i113">Plate X.</a>, which is not
so well drawn as the Methuselah.</p>

form.</p>

<p>The fact is that the twelfth and thirteenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
century convention in figure drawing had served
its turn well, but was now worn out. Deriving,
originally, as we have seen, out of Greek art
in its Byzantine form, it had formed a stock on
which the artist of the Early Period had been
able to graft his own observation and love of
nature, but it had now ceased to satisfy and was
therefore abandoned. The progress of drawing
in other arts, or at all events in sculpture, had
taught men to demand something different. The
artist of the late thirteenth century, as the last
influence of Greek art died out of his work,
had undoubtedly neglected grace of form in his
enthusiasm for vigorous and naturalistic movement;
and, as so often happens when one quality
in art is neglected, a reaction had come, in which
people demanded that quality above all others.
Consequently, the chief effort of the draughtsman
of the fourteenth century, if I understand
him rightly, was to bring his drawing of form
up to the standard required of him, the S-like
attitude, for instance, being merely a trick to get
a willowy gracefulness into his figures, especially
those of women.</p>

<p>The same tendency is observable in the drawing
of drapery. The drapery of the thirteenth century
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
was entirely conventional in the method in which
it was drawn, but it was always in movement and
helped the action of the figures. Fourteenth
century drapery, on the other hand, is always
at rest, or at most sweeping with the slow movement
of a figure, but its folds are drawn in a
much more advanced manner than before, and
seem to bear evidence of a certain amount of
direct study of actual drapery, either on the part
of the artist or of those whom he was following.
The ideal of gracefulness shows itself in a love
for long and sweeping folds, as may be seen in
Plates <a href="#i243">XXIV.</a>, <a href="#i295">XXX.</a>, <a href="#i303">XXXI.</a></p>

<p>At first the artist is content to use in his
drawing the strong line work of the preceding
period, but as the century proceeds this becomes
rather more delicate, and he begins to feel his
way towards modelling in half-tones. The drapery
over the Virgin's knees in <a href="#i217">Plate XXI.</a> shows this
very clearly.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i259" id="i259"></a>

<p class="caption">PLATE XXVI<br />

</div>

<p class="sidenote">Neglect of
movement.</p>

<p>With this preoccupation with the truer rendering
of form, it is perhaps not surprising that the
study of action was neglected. The artist had
enough to do to draw his figures and drapery
in repose without making them move about
and do things, and a contributory cause was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
no doubt, the weakening of interest already
alluded to in the subjects he had to illustrate.
This then is why, whereas in the thirteenth century
we find a highly conventional rendering of
form allied to naturalism in movement, in the
fourteenth, conversely, we find conventional poses
and movement allied to a more naturalistic rendering
of form.</p>

<p>Comparative study of the illuminated manuscripts
of the same period shows exactly the same
changes in progress. So closely do the two arts
keep pace with each other that I do not think
it can be said that at any time either was leading
the other. They must have been in very close
touch even if they were not, which it is quite
possible they often were, practised by the same
artists. The lead, if there was a lead, must have
come from sculpture.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Natural
plant forms
in ornament.</p>

<p>(6) <i>The use of Natural Plant Forms in Ornament.</i>&mdash;This
is another manifestation of the same spirit,
and divides the work of the fourteenth century
most sharply from that both of the preceding and
following periods. The Jesse Trees, and the leafy
scrolls and borders of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries belong to no genus known to botanists,
but in the fourteenth century it seems as if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
artist, the inspiration of religion failing him, had
sought it in a rather literal study of Nature.
Accordingly in the grisaille and borders of this
period we find patterns formed of oak leaves and
acorns, ivy leaves, maple, vine, and so on. Plate <a href="#i259">XXVI.</a>
is rather an exception in that one cannot
name the particular plant; but Plates <a href="#i275">XXVIII.</a>
and <a href="#i287">XXIX.</a> contain characteristic examples, and
<a href="#i217">Plate XXI.</a> shows a good vine border from York,
and some holly leaf grisaille.</p>

<p>Yet the feeling for Nature in these patterns does
not go very deep. The artist is, for instance,
content to make the oak wreath and twine itself
as freely as the vine, and I always feel that his
practice is the result of theory rather than the
spontaneous expression of love of Nature. The
earlier worker was really, I believe, more in tune
with Nature than his successor of the fourteenth
century. He did not copy her forms in ornament
but he followed her principles. He did not copy
her forms, because she had taught him to design
forms for himself. Nature, it may be observed,
does not adorn one object with copies of another,
hardly even when she gives her creatures protective
colouring and markings, but gives to each the
patterning which suits it best. In the same way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
the ornament of the twelfth and thirteenth century
artist is always perfectly suited to its purpose
without distracting one's attention; and when his
subject requires him to represent a tree or a bush,&mdash;such
as the fig tree under which Nathanael sits, or
the thicket in which the ram is caught, at Canterbury,&mdash;though
the foliage is that of the shamrock,
he knows how to make it grow and live better than
his fourteenth century successor. The waves, too,
of the Flood in <a href="#i053">Plate IV.</a>, conventional though
they are, give a real sense of tossing and stormy
water.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Change in
material.<br /><br />

Fourteenth
century
colour
schemes.</p>

<p>(7) <i>The Quality of Glass and the Colours Used.</i>&mdash;At
first these differ little from those used in the
previous period, but as the fourteenth century
proceeds, the rich intense reds and blues, with their
"streakiness," their endless variety of tone and
texture, which makes each piece of glass a jewel
with an individuality of its own, and needing no
enrichment, give way to glass of a thinner, flatter
quality. In <a href="#i041">Plate III.</a> Mr. Saint has managed to
catch and the printer to reproduce something of
the quality of these early blues. There is a change
too in the proportions of the colours used. The
colour schemes of the Early Period are almost
always conceived on a basis of red and blue, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
now green and yellow become equally important;
Plates <a href="#i217">XXI.</a>, <a href="#i225">XXII.</a>, for example, contain very
little blue at all. The canopies when not white
are mainly yellow, and this alone is responsible for
a very large amount of yellow in the colour scheme&mdash;too
much, in fact, as a rule. The yellow used
at first, till silver stain took its place, was, as I
have said, a rather hot unpleasant pot-metal. The
green of the First Period had been a rather sharp
brilliant colour, used generally in small quantities,
and striking a high shrill note among the deep
reds and blues, like a clarionet in an orchestra.
The typical green of the fourteenth century, on the
other hand, which is often used as a background,
is a greyer duller colour altogether. <a href="#i169">Plate XVI.</a>
and <a href="#i217">Plate XXI.</a> give a fairly good idea of its
quality.</p>

<p class="sidenote">White glass
for flesh.</p>

<p>Another change, which was the natural result,
both of the increased amount of white now used
in windows and of the introduction of the silver
stain, was the gradual substitution of white glass
in the flesh of figures for the brownish pink
formerly used. Its use afforded an opportunity
for getting white in amongst the colour, and so
helping to bind the design together, and the fact
that the hair, crowns, and mitres of figures could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
now be stained yellow, rendered it on the whole
the most suitable glass for the purpose, and we find
it holding the field down to the late sixteenth
century, when a pinkish enamel began to be used.</p>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">Painted
diapers.</p>

<p>(8) <i>The use of Painted Diaper Patterns on the
Coloured Backgrounds.</i>&mdash;The red and blue backgrounds
to the figures in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries needed no further decoration. Their
own depth and quality was enough in itself, but
the thinner, flatter tones that succeeded them
needed enriching and giving texture to, in order
to throw the figures up into proper relief; or so
the fourteenth century artist seems to have felt,
for from the beginning we find his backgrounds
usually covered with a diaper painted in enamel.</p>

<p>The method is always the same; the ground
having been covered with an even coat of enamel,
the pattern is scratched out clear with the point
of a stick or a brush handle. Plates <a href="#i169">XVI.</a>, <a href="#i205">XX.</a>,
<a href="#i217">XXI.</a> are typical examples, and show in detail the
kind of pattern that was used.</p>

<p>It is very rarely that we find anything of the
kind in the previous period. There is, as we
have seen, an isolated and early example of it at
Canterbury, where a rather paler, poorer blue has
been used than in the other windows, but there it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
is more delicate than in the fourteenth century,
the pattern being scratched out of a very thin
semi-transparent mat of enamel; and it is found
too in some late thirteenth century windows in
St. Urbain at Troyes, but in fourteenth century
work it is frequently met with even at the beginning
of the period, and by the end of the first
quarter of the century it is the rule, and remains
so throughout the succeeding century as well.

<h2 class="p6">IX<br />

EARLY FOURTEENTH CENTURY GLASS<br />
IN ENGLAND<br />
<br />
(MERTON COLLEGE AND EXETER)</h2>

<p>The windows in the chapel of Merton College,
Oxford, are perhaps the earliest in which the
design of the Second Period has taken a definite
and typical form. Antony à Wood, in his catalogue
of Fellows, says that the donor, Henry de
Mamesfield or Mannesfield, whose portrait is in
the windows, caused them to be made in 1283,
but in view of an order in the Bursar's Rolls of
1292 for stone for building these windows, this
date must be rejected. Antony à Wood's statement
elsewhere that the <i>whole</i> chapel was pulled
down and rebuilt in 1424 shows he is not altogether
to be relied on. The presence of the fleur-de-lis
with the castle of Castile in some of the borders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
makes it probable<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> that they were done after
Edward I.'s second marriage with Margaret of
France in 1299, while the arms of an Heir-Apparent
as well as of a King of England in
the east window makes it certain that they were
executed while Edward I. and his son were both
alive, <i>i.e.</i> before 1307. On the whole, and by
comparison with the York glass, I should think
1303-1305 a not improbable date for them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The east
window.</p>

<p>There are seven windows on each side and a
great east window, and, with the exception of the
latter, they are still fairly perfect. Of the east
window it is only the beautiful "wheel" tracery
which retains its original glass, the lower lights,
alas! having been destroyed in 1702 to make room
for a monstrosity by one Pryce&mdash;a horrible blare
of yellow. What remains in the tracery has a
more transitional character than the other windows,
and was probably executed first, and if only the
lower lights had remained they might have thrown
an interesting light on the development of the
style.</p>

<p>The three trefoils in the centre of the wheel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
contain three coats of arms&mdash;the short triangular
shields of the thirteenth century, of which the
first is that of Edward I., the leopards of England;
the second the same with a label of five points
azure for his son, afterwards Edward II.; and the
third that of Walter de Merton, the founder of
the college. For the most part the other lights
contain ornament that is wholly fourteenth century
in character, but the quatrefoil on each side has
a feature which shows the early date of the
window. In these two small figures representing
the Annunciation, though themselves in the style
and colouring of the early fourteenth century,
are placed directly on a background of red and
blue mosaic diaper, such as one finds again and
again in thirteenth century work in France, and
among the fragments in the South Rose at Lincoln.
I have often thought that thirteenth century
glaziers sometimes kept this mosaic filling in stock,
and perhaps the artist of Merton had some left
on his hands and used it up here. In any case it
would seem to show that the style in which he was
working was fairly new to his workshop.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The side
windows.</p>

<p>The fourteen side windows are designed on a plan
which is typical of fourteenth century work both
in England and in France, especially Normandy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
The sections into which the glazing is divided by
the heavy iron frame-bars are taken as the units of
the design. One in each light is filled with a
coloured panel&mdash;a figure under a canopy&mdash;and the
rest with grisaille having a coloured boss in the
centre of each, the whole being surrounded by a
coloured border. The effect is that of a range of
greenish-white windows just dotted and edged with
colour, and with a single broad band of colour
running horizontally through them all. This plan
is common in all early fourteenth century work,
especially in England and Normandy. Evreux is
another example, York nave another, but with two
rows of coloured panels, and the window from
Rouen in <a href="#i253">Plate XXV.</a> is only an elaboration of it
forty years later. At Merton College, however,
the canopy has not yet run mad, but is of modest
proportions, figure and canopy together only
occupying one section of glazing.</p>

<p>The grisaille itself is for the most part of
"bulged" quarries curving round the central bosses,
but two on each side have true quarries. All have
the trellis pattern formed by doubling the lead
with a painted line and a continuous flowing
pattern of foliage&mdash;vine, oak, ivy, and fig&mdash;spreading
through it over the window from a central stem.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
<a href="#i259">Plate XXVI.</a> is a later example of the same thing,
but with the addition of silver stain, which is
nowhere found in the Merton windows.</p>

<p>The borders, when not formed of castle and
fleur-de-lis, are of a kind found in the Chapter-House
at York, and common in other fourteenth
century windows&mdash;leaves white or yellow, branching
at intervals from a straight or wavy stem on a
coloured ground. There is not much variety in
the coloured bosses, which all consist either of a
simple four-leaved pattern or of a small head in
white on a coloured disc. There are, I think, only
four different designs of these heads&mdash;Christ, an
old man, a king, and a queen continually repeated.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Poverty of
ideas.</p>

<p>The most woeful poverty of ideas is, however,
found in the figures under the canopies. There
are fourteen windows of three lights each, with a
figure in each,&mdash;forty-two in all,&mdash;yet the designer
could think of nothing better to do than to put an
apostle in the centre light of each window, repeating
two apostles to make them go round, and in every
window but two a kneeling figure of the donor&mdash;"Magister
Enricus de Mamesfield"&mdash;in the light
on each side. Thus the proud and happy Master
Henry might see himself reproduced no less than
four-and-twenty times, in robes of red, white,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
brown or blue, wide sleeved robes with a hood,
doubtless the M.A.'s gown of the period.</p>

<p>Neither are the apostles very interestingly
treated. They are almost repetitions of each other,
standing in the same conventional pose and distinguished
only by their attributes. The backgrounds
of the figures are diapered with enamel in
the usual fourteenth century way.</p>

<p>In point of development these windows come
between the Chapter-House and the earliest nave
windows at York, and correspond with the earliest
work at Evreux, being the earliest windows in
which the style of the Second Period has taken
final and definite form. They are not without
their beauty, but in looking at them one wonders
what has become of the spirit that created the
windows of Canterbury, Chartres, and Bourges.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Exeter east
window.</p>

<p>Of the same stage of development as the Merton
windows are the earliest of the figures remaining in
the east window of Exeter Cathedral. Although
this window was rebuilt and enlarged in 1390, the
original glass was, it is known, used again and eked
out with new. There is an entry in the Fabric
Rolls of 1301-1302 for 1271 feet of glass at 5½d. per
foot, "ad summas fenestras frontis novi operis"&mdash;which
seems to mean the east end of the choir,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
and two years later a payment to Master Walter
the glazier for fixing the glass "summi gabuli,"
but no further light is thrown on its origin. Later
on, however, in the roll for 1317-1318, there is an
entry for glass, apparently for the Lady Chapel,
"bought at Rouen" at the rate of 6d. a foot for
white (? grisaille) and 1s. 0d. for coloured, and
from this it has been argued that the whole of the
glass up to that time was bought from Rouen too.
To me, however, the fact that Rouen is specifically
mentioned here, and nowhere else, militates against
this theory, while if the price of 5½d. a foot paid for
the glass of the east window was for finished figure
work, it is far lower than that of the Rouen glass.
The figures themselves are much larger than those
at Merton College, and on the whole more interestingly
treated. There are nine of them remaining:
three patriarchs; three apostles&mdash;St. Peter, St.
Paul, and St. Andrew; and three female saints&mdash;St.
Margaret, St. Catherine, and, I think, the
Magdalen. The canopies are large in proportion,
being nearly twice the height of the figures,&mdash;an
unusual height for so early a date,&mdash;but they are
not unlike the Merton canopies in style. There is
no trace of silver stain either in the canopies or
the figures.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p>Another fact which to some extent tells against
the theory of their Rouen origin, is that so far I
have found no glass of that date at Rouen which
at all resembles them, whereas as late as 1290-1295
Clement of Chartres was, as we have seen, doing
work there, which shows little change from the
style of the middle of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Grisaille at
Exeter.</p>

<p>There is some very interesting grisaille in two
of the chapels at Exeter, of an earlier type than
that at Merton, being in fact transitional between
the style of the First and Second Periods. It has
the interlacing medallions of coloured strap work,
with the painted grisaille pattern passing behind
them, but this latter, though chiefly of the "Herba
Benedicta," breaks here and there into natural
leafage. It is a slightly earlier point of development
than even the Chapter-House at York, and
corresponds very closely with some at St. Urbain at
Troyes.

FOURTEENTH CENTURY GLASS<br />
AT YORK</h2>

<p>The best work of the Second Period that I know
of anywhere is to be found in York Minster.
Here the new style seems to have become engrafted
on a strong local school which had preserved much
of the life and vigour of the previous age. It is
true that even here one finds a certain weakening
of the religious motive, but its place seems to be
to some extent taken by a patriotic enthusiasm for
a warrior king and for the gallant nobles who
followed him in the Scotch wars, and whose arms
are everywhere in the glass of the nave.</p>

<p>The windows themselves show a steady and
almost unbroken progression in style from the late
thirteenth to the early part of the fifteenth century,
which makes them most useful for study. Leaving
out the fragments of very early glass I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>

seems to be&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">The Chapter-House.</p>

<p>The "Five Sisters" have already been dealt with
in their place in the First Period. Those of
the Chapter-House, whether of earlier or later date
than those of the Merton College Chapel, are distinctly
earlier in style and are one of the few
examples of work that is really transitional between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
the First and Second Periods, belonging almost as
much to one as to the other. Unfortunately there
is no record of the building of the Chapter-House,
and its date is a matter of dispute, Drake putting it
as early as the time of Archbishop Walter Grey,
who died in 1256, and Browne holding it was not
finished till nearly 1340&mdash;an impossible date for
the glass. As in Merton Chapel the presence of
the fleur-de-lis as well as the castle of Castile
in the windows may mean that they are not
earlier than 1299, but I do not think they are much
later. The only French work I know of which at
all corresponds to it is in St. Urbain at Troyes,
which Viollet-le-Duc dates at about 1295, and the
windows from Poitiers in <a href="#i161">Plate XV.</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">The grisaille
in the
Chapter-House.</p>

<p>The windows are divided by the tracery into
narrow lights in which a series of coloured medallions
of typical thirteenth century shape are placed
one above the other on a ground of grisaille, much
as in the window from Poitiers. It is in the
grisaille itself that the beginnings of the new style
are shown, for whereas in the "Five Sisters," which
are certainly later than 1260, the pattern on the
grisaille is the conventional trefoil of the First
Period&mdash;the Herba Benedicta&mdash;and conforms to the
shapes of the lead-work and of the hollow medallions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
outlined in coloured bands, in the Chapter-House,
although the medallions in coloured outline
are still there, the painted pattern, as at Exeter
and Troyes, runs through them independently of
them (giving them a rather meaningless appearance
of being hung in front of it), but is wholly formed
of natural foliage, oak, fig, ivy, and so on; the
borders, too, are of the character of the Second
Period. Similar grisaille is found at Chartham in
Kent. At Poitiers, as may be seen in the illustration,
the grisaille pattern is still of the Herba
Benedicta, with a cross-hatched ground, and the
border is of an earlier type; at St. Urbain at
Troyes, as at Exeter, both the conventional and the
natural foliage are found, but on the whole I am
somewhat inclined to think that wherever the
other features of the style originated these patterns
of natural foliage were first used in England.</p>

<p>These windows, by the way, are in a sad state
and want releading, instead of which the authorities
have contented themselves with placing quarry
glazing on the outside of them, which now that it
is dirty so darkens the old windows as to kill all
light and colour in them. When I say releading,

<p class="sidenote">The Chapter-House
vestibule.</p>

<p>The windows in the <b>L</b>-shaped vestibule, or
passage, which leads to the Chapter-House show
a slight further development. Here the grisaille is
of the same character as in the Chapter-House
itself, but the coloured panels are each surmounted
by a little crocketted canopy, which here appears
for the first time in York. It is found in some
glass at Selling, in Kent (which from the heraldry
seems to commemorate Edward I.'s marriage to
Margaret of France in 1299), in conjunction with
grisaille in which the foliage is of the earlier conventional
type, and which therefore may, perhaps,
be a little earlier than these windows.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
clerestory of
the nave.</p>

<p>The windows in the clerestory of the nave of
York Minster are little, I think, if at all, later
than those in the Chapter-House, but it is a little
difficult to compare them as they are designed to
be seen at such a very different distance from the
eye, the white parts of the clerestory windows
consisting only of interlacing bands of lead-work
without any painted pattern at all. A small inset
in <a href="#i189">Plate XVIII.</a> shows the general arrangement
of all these windows; the great wheel of the
tracery, it will be seen, is filled with colour, while
the lower lights are white with two bands of
coloured panels running horizontally through them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
all. Of these panels the lower row consists of coats
of arms of the great families of the North, contained
in medallions of which <a href="#i169">Plate XVI.</a> is an
example. The upper row consists for the most
part of subjects contained in somewhat similar
medallions, but many of the panels are filled with
earlier glass of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
which were doubtless preserved from the older
nave. Thus, if you let your eye run along the
northern side it will be arrested at the extreme
west end of the line by a piece of blue that is
different from all the others. It is the twelfth
century blue that we have seen at St. Denis and
in the west windows at Chartres, and the panel is
the portion of a Jesse Tree of the same pattern as
that which is found at both those places, and which
I mentioned when speaking of them. Portions of
the foliage of the tree are in the tracery above. I
think I recognize this blue too in a panel on the
south side representing a man with a horse and cart,
and remains of early thirteenth century glass are
plentiful.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The aisles of
the nave.</p>

<p>Next after the clerestory, the oldest windows in
the nave are the first five from the east in each
aisle. In these the style of the Second Period is
fully developed and is in no sense transitional.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
They are rather more advanced in style than the
Merton College windows and are by a far finer
artist, being, in fact, the finest work of the period
that I know. They seem to me all to have been
executed within a few years of each other, probably
in continuous succession, and to show the gradual
development which might be expected during the
progress of the work.</p>

<p>Those on the north are the oldest and in the
best condition, those on the south being much
broken and confused, and one, alas! "restored."
The general design is the same in all and is a
typical fourteenth century one, two horizontal
bands of coloured panels surmounted by canopies
running horizontally through all the lights,
separated by panels of grisaille which have a
coloured spot in the centre of each panel. It is
characteristic of the fourteenth century that the
whole of the lower panels are in nearly every
window devoted to the donor, who is thus given as
much space as the subject. The grisaille is of the
same type as at Merton. As in all early fourteenth
century work, the sections divided by the heavy
frame-bars are taken as the units of the design, the
coloured panels with their canopies each occupying
two sections and the grisaille panels one each.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Nos. 2, 3, and 4 on the north were probably the
first executed, as they contain no trace of yellow
stain (<a href="#i177">Plate XVII.</a>b). No. 5, from which the
border of monks in their stalls in <a href="#i177">Plate XVII.</a>a is
taken, has a single touch of it in one place, but in
No. 1 it is used, though still sparingly and tentatively,
on the beaks and claws of the eagles in the
borders of the outer lights (<a href="#i177">Plate XVII.</a>c) and on
the mail of the knights in the border of the centre
light (<a href="#i189">Plate XVIII.</a>), and here and there in the
canopy. Another fresh development is the prolonging
of the pinnacles of the canopy into the
grisaille panel above.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Peter
de Dene
window.</p>

<p>This window, which is sometimes called the
Heraldic Window, from the number of coats of
arms it contains, is the only one of them that has
hitherto been the subject of any very close study,
Mr. Winston having devoted a whole article to an
extremely close and careful analysis of its heraldry,
and to an account of the life of its donor, one Peter
de Dene, whose portrait is in the central light and
who was a churchman-politician under the first two
Edwards. There is no space here to repeat his
arguments, and I will only say that, after reading
them and rereading them, I find it very difficult
not to accept his conclusion that the most probable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
date for the window is 1306. The subject panels
represent the story of St. Catherine, but are the
least interesting part of the window, of which the
most charming feature is, perhaps, the border of the
central light, which consists of miniature portraits
of kings, queens, and nobles whom the donor wished
to compliment (<a href="#i189">Plate XVIII.</a>). The two uppermost
figures are those of a Templar and a
Hospitaller; below them are the kings and queens
of England and France, in allusion to Edward I.'s
second marriage, and the recent peace concluded
by it; below the Queen of France is the Heir-Apparent
of England, and the remaining figures
bear the arms of de Clare, Earl of Gloucester,
Warrenne (both connected with the Royal Family),
Beauchamp, Ros, Mowbray, Clifford, and Percy.
The coats of arms which form the bosses in the
white panels are those of foreign monarchs with
whom the King of England was connected. The
white eagles in the outer border are thought by
Winston to refer to Piers Gaveston, who, though
somewhat under a cloud in 1306, yet, as the friend
of the heir to the throne, was a good person to
keep in favour with. It is true the Gaveston eagles
were golden, but heraldry was more free and easy
then than later. There is a portrait of Prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Edward in the Chapter-House with a white falcon
on his wrist, and white falcons are plentiful in the
windows of the nave, yet I have never heard of his
using it as a badge, though the last Plantagenet,
Richard II., did so.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Bell-founder's
window.</p>

<p>The next window to this is the famous "Bell-founder's
Window," given by Richard Tunnoc,
bell-founder of York. In the lower panel of the
centre light is his portrait kneeling and presenting
a model of the window to an Archbishop, perhaps
St. William. The panels on either side represent
one, the casting, the other the turning of a bell in a
lathe. Bells are everywhere in the window, the
canopies are hung with them in rows, the borders
are formed of them, but Mr. Westlake's careless
remark that all six panels represent the process of
bell-making is not true. The upper three are
much perished, but one can just see that they tell
the story of St. William's return to York, when
the welcoming crowds broke down Ouse Bridge,
but when, through his intercession, not a life was
lost.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The de la
Warde
window.</p>

<p>The third window contains some interesting
portraits in its lower panels. The central one is
that of an Archbishop of York, as shown by the
key in his left hand, holding in his right a model
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
of the nave<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. On the left is a knight dismounted,
holding his horse by the bridle, and behind him the
hand of some one out of the picture holds his
banner, which the painting, though almost obliterated,
still shows to be "vairé" argent and sable.
In the opposite panel is a lady standing and behind
her, half out of the picture, a man on horseback,
doubtless his wife and son. Now the arms on the
banner are those of the Barons de la Warde, of whom
there were only two, Robert and his son Simon.
Robert, who was in the Scotch wars, and in 1306
was steward of the household to Edward I., must
have passed the greater part of that year in York
with the King, who was there preparing for his last
expedition against Robert Bruce. He, Robert de
la Warde, died next year. His son Simon was
Governor of York in 1321, and helped with his
forces to defeat Thomas of Lancaster at Boroughbridge.
It will thus be seen that the window might
either have been given by the father in 1306 or the
son about 1320, but since two figures are represented,
and since we know that Simon died childless (the
barony becoming extinct), it seems probable that
it was executed in the father's lifetime. Again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
though 1320 would fit the Bell-founder's window,
since Tunnoc was Sheriff of York that year, it
cannot be made to fit the facts in Peter de Dene's
window, which is certainly not earlier but later.
The presence of the Templar is against it, as it is
unthinkable that the Order which was suppressed
in 1312 (and its grandmaster burnt) should thus
have been complimented in 1320. But for this fact
I am bound to say I should have thought 1320
the more probable.</p>

<p>If then we accept 1306 as the approximate date
for these windows, it will be seen that in little more
than seven years a complete change had come over
the design of English stained glass, and it will
presently be seen that much the same thing was
happening in France at the same time. Indeed,
one of the surprising things about mediæval art is
the rapidity with which new ideas seem to flash
across Europe from Yorkshire to Dalmatia.</p>

<p>The outer lights of the de la Warde window
have a fascinating border of monkeys bearing
pitchers, and across the bottom of the window is a
busy scene of monkeys hunting and feasting, with a
man and woman among them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The fifth
window in
the north
aisle.</p>

<p>The three lower panels of the fifth window
illustrate a story which I have never yet found any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
one to give me a clue to. It has nothing to do
with the upper subjects, two of which are the
martyrdoms of SS. Peter and Paul, the third being
merely fragments. From its position, and from the
fact that the costume is contemporary with the
painting, I should rather imagine that it refers to
some local story, perhaps connected in some way
with the gift of the window. On the right, a figure
in a red cope with a red skull-cap but no nimbus,
holding a scourge or "disciplina" in his hand, is
pointing apparently in denunciation at what appears
to be a cringing figure in brown, much broken,
among a crowd of others, some of whom are women.
In the next panel, which is also much broken and
jumbled, the same figures seem to be there, but the
one in red seems to be exhorting rather than
denouncing. The third or left-hand panel is in
much better condition, and here we see the figures
plainly. The one in brown, which turns out to be
that of a layman, without armour, but with a
dagger at his side and a spiked mace slung over his
left arm, is kneeling at the feet of the figure in red,
who is seated, and with one hand laid on the
penitent's head is with the other firmly administering
the "disciplina" to his back! The border is of
monks (or canons) in their stalls, and the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
heraldry in the window is contained in the painted
diaper on the blue background, and consists of
spread eagles and rampant lions, like the border of
the Peter de Dene window. The remains of the
donor's name&mdash;<span class="smcap">W ... MN ... CTON</span>&mdash;gives me
no clue.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The de
Mauley
window.</p>

<p>The first five windows in the south aisle seem
to me to follow these immediately in order of
execution. The style is just a little more advanced;
stain is used more freely, and the canopies begin to
grow up into the white panel above them until
their pinnacles reach its centre and do away with
the coloured boss there altogether; they spread
into the borders in many cases in order to give
more room to the figures under them, thus giving
rise to the three-gabled form of canopy. In colour
they are still very beautiful, but have suffered
much more damage than those in the north aisle.
Several of them have been repaired and restored
by Peckitt, of York, as the inscriptions show, at
the end of the eighteenth century, but Peckitt's
restoration was merciful compared to that which
the fourth one has undergone at the hands of
a modern firm of stained-glass manufacturers.
Whole quantities of the old glass have been
replaced by new, and the whole has been smeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
with some brownish mess to make it look old
again. As a result, all life and beauty have gone
out of the window which is merely a sort of
embalmed corpse, and this is the more to be
regretted that it seems to have been a particularly
interesting window. The lower panels each contain
a pair of kneeling figures, five knights, and one
churchman who hold aloft shields which show
them to be various members of the Yorkshire
family of de Mauley of Mulgrave. The founder of
the family was the Poitevin ruffian, Piers de
Mauley who, at King John's orders, murdered
Prince Arthur and was rewarded for this service
with the hand and estates of an unfortunate Yorkshire
heiress. The descendants of this miscreant
seem, however, to have been gallant soldiers
who distinguished themselves in Scotland and
Gascony and were made barons by Edward I. A
peculiarity of the family was that the eldest son
was always called Peter, and they distinguished
themselves by numbers, like kings. One of the
portraits must be the particular Peter who afterwards,
in 1346, commanded the forces which Queen
Philippa raised in her husband's absence against
the invading Scots, whom he routed at Neville's
Cross, taking their king, David Bruce, prisoner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
and partly avenging Bannockburn. An interesting
point of heraldry is the way in which the arms of
the different sons are distinguished, not by the
marks of cadency used later, but by the addition of
different charges to the original shield which is or,
a bend sable.</p>

<p>The fifth window was once a Tree of Jesse but is
now a mere wreck. It is, however, the earliest Jesse
Tree I know of in which the stem and foliage of the
tree are green.</p>

<p>These windows show a progressive increase in
the use of white for flesh colour instead of the
brownish pink formerly used. At first, white is
used only for women's faces, and then for those of
saints of both sexes, brown-pink continuing to be
used for other people till quite the middle of the
century or later. Stain is not used on the hair at
first, but sometimes a thin brown matt of enamel is
laid all over the hair which at a distance has almost
the effect of stain.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The sixth
window in
the north
aisle.</p>

<p>The sixth window on the north side is, I think,
a good many years later in date than these ten
windows we have been considering, and is much
less beautiful. A canopy and border from it are
shown in <a href="#i189">Plate XVIII.</a>a on the right. Although
the same general arrangement is adhered to as in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
the other windows, the treatment is much coarser;
the crockets of the canopies are big, heavy, and
ugly, of a brownish-yellow pot-metal, but at the
same time stain is freely, indeed lavishly, used, not
only in the canopies and borders but, for the first
time in the Cathedral, in the quarries of the
grisaille as well. The borders of heraldry or little
figures have given way to running patterns of
natural foliage of the more common fourteenth
century type. There are four different patterns
of these borders in the window, so that some
probably came from another window of the same
date, perhaps in the now empty seventh window.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The west
windows.</p>

<p>Later still are the three west windows and the
sixth in the south aisle which mark a further stage
in development. Here we have at last a definite
date to help us, for the contract with the glazier,
one Robert, is still in existence and is dated 1338,
so we may assume the windows were finished
about 1340. It is difficult to judge these windows
fairly, for they were subjected to a most drastic
restoration in the eighteenth century, and the great
central one is further disfigured by protective
quarry glazing on the outside, which reduces it to a
dirty brown. I do not think, however, that they
can ever have been, comparatively speaking, very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
good, and I am inclined to look upon them as
perhaps the poorest work of the Middle Ages.
<a href="#i197">Plate XIX.</a> shows one light of the northernmost
of the three, that at the west end of the north aisle.
It will be seen that the canopy has now grown to
an absurd height and fills the whole light, and
neither in its proportions nor in its details is it very
graceful. The border is now growing narrower
and narrower, and is eventually doomed to disappear
altogether. The crockets of the gable are
the only yellow pot-metal used, silver stain being
used everywhere else, and not very artistically,
though how far this is due to the restorer it is
difficult to say.</p>

<p class="caption">PLATE XXXIII<br />

</div>

<p>The same qualities may be observed in the
great central west window of the nave, also the
work of the glazier Robert. Here, too, the
canopies over the various rows of figures which
form the design meet the feet of the row above,
and in the top row shoot up to the head of the
light. Their stiff awkwardness is in curious contrast
to the wonderful flowing grace of the actual
tracery of the window which contains them. The
treatment of the figures, too, is dull. For the
eight archbishops who form the bottom row, only
two different patterns have been used, and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
row above the eleven apostles have been got into
eight lights by making six of them squeeze, most
uncomfortably, two in a niche.</p>

<p>The St. Stephen (<a href="#i205">Plate XX.</a>) is from the sixth
window in the south aisle, which seems to be of
about the same date as the west windows and
probably by the same glazier Robert. Instead of
conforming to the design of the other windows in
the aisle, he has filled it with three figures larger
than life under tall canopies. It has likewise
suffered much from eighteenth century restoration
(the head, I think, is new), and has, besides, the
same faults as the west windows. To me its chief
interest is in the ornamentation of the saints'
dalmatic, which affords the earliest example I
know of the use of silver stain on blue glass,
which may be seen in the ring-like ornaments on
the blue stripes.</p>

<p class="sidenote">All Saints',
North Street,
and
St. Martin's,
Micklegate.</p>

<p>The parish churches of York contain a good
deal of fourteenth as well as fifteenth century
glass. The windows in the west end of the north
aisle of All Saints', North Street, and the south
aisle of St. Martin's, Micklegate, Plates <a href="#i217">XXI.</a> and
<a href="#i225">XXII.</a>, are not very easy to place with regard to
the Cathedral work. My own opinion is that they
are rather later and show a recovery in quality.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
The canopies are as big as ever, but there is more
taste and refinement in the drawing, both of the
figures and ornaments, and more experience as
well as taste in the use of the silver stain. At
the same time, they contain later features, such
as the attempt at perspective in the battlements
above the canopy in <a href="#i217">Plate XXI.</a>, and in the
brackets of a sort of balcony (not shown in the
illustration) below. The curious device above the
canopy in the window at St. Martin's (<a href="#i225">Plate XXII.</a>)
is, I imagine, the "merchant's mark" of
the donor.

FOURTEENTH CENTURY GLASS<br />
IN FRANCE</h2>

<p class="sidenote">St. Pierre
at Chartres.</p>

<p>In France the change of style seems to have
occurred very much at the same time as in
England. There is some transitional work in
St. Urbain at Troyes, to which Viollet-le-Duc
gives the date 1295. This would make it a few
years earlier in all probability than the Chapter-House
at York, but the type of grisaille is rather
earlier too, still consisting partly, like that at
Exeter, of conventional foliage. The clerestory
windows of the fine church of St. Pierre at
Chartres, whatever their precise date, certainly
mark the local change from the previous style.</p>

<p>The church had been begun as early as 1150,
but its progress was slow and it was not completed
till 1225, though the choir had been glazed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
1172.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The upper part of this choir was, however,
pulled down in 1270, and rebuilt with large
traceried windows, filling all the wall space of the
clerestory. This again was not finished till 1310,
but this date probably refers to the completion of
the interior decoration which was always preceded
by the glazing of the windows. On the whole, I
think it is fairly safe to conclude that the choir
windows were done about 1300, or a little before.</p>

<p>The style is still that of the First Period but
modified, experimentally as it were, to suit new
conditions. Each window has four tall narrow
lights with tracery above, and every other light
is filled with two large figures placed one above
the other each in a medallion, which is squeezed
by the narrowness of the light into an elongated
form, while the space between the medallions is
filled in the old way with mosaic diaper of red
and blue. In compliance, however, with the
growing demand for more light in churches, the
other two lights in each window are filled entirely
with grisaille. This would give a lop-sided appearance
to a single window, but seen together with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
only a slender shaft between window and window,
they form a succession of alternate white and
coloured vertical stripes all round the choir, an
interesting and almost unique method of combining
figure and grisaille. Altogether the clerestory
windows may be considered as the very last work
of the First Period already modified and influenced
by the spirit of change that was in the air.</p>

<p>In the clerestory windows of the nave the
change has already come about. Although in the
richness of colouring there is still a reminiscence
of the earlier style, yet the medallion has vanished,
and everywhere, both over single figures and over
subject panels, we find decorated canopies, not yet,
however, of exaggerated proportions, and with a
complete absence of yellow stain. In the general
arrangement the same idea is seen as in the choir,
but it has had to be adapted to a different form of
window-opening. The nave is part of the original
church of 1225, and the clerestory windows consist,
like those of the Cathedral, of broad lights grouped
in pairs, with a rose above each pair&mdash;the germ of
tracery. Every alternate pair is entirely filled with
small coloured scenes from the life of a saint,&mdash;no
longer in medallions, but each framed under a
small white canopy,&mdash;but the windows between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
them have only a vertical stripe of colour down
the centre of each light containing two large
figures, one above the other, while the rest of the
light is filled with grisaille (<a href="#i233">Plate XXIII.</a>).</p>

<p>The portrait of a certain abbot as donor enables
us to date these nave windows with fair accuracy
as about 1307-8, which makes them slightly later
than the Peter de Dene window in York Minster.
The grisaille is, however, of a distinctly earlier
type, having the background still cross-hatched,
but at Chartres one would expect the old traditions
to die hard.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Fourteenth
century glass
in Chartres
Cathedral.</p>

<p>There is fourteenth century work in the Cathedral,
which is interesting in its way. The window
given, about 1307-10, by "Geoffrey the Restorer,"
a canon whose "restoration" of the thirteenth
century windows was of a different kind to that
now in vogue, is the work of an archæologist and
an enthusiast for the older style and can hardly
be taken as typical. Very different is the strip
of glazing which Canon Thierry got leave, in 1328,
to insert in the foot of one of the big thirteenth
century windows in the south transept to light an
altar he had founded. Even for its date it is
remarkable, consisting, as it does, of figures (Canon
Thierry kneeling to the Virgin surrounded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
saints) executed entirely in white and silver stain,
without any coloured glass, placed directly on a
background of white and stain quarries. It is
perhaps the first examples of this treatment of
figures, and anything more hopelessly out of
keeping with the deep and solemn colours above
it can hardly be imagined, so that it is difficult
to do it justice. An example of <i>coloured</i> figures
placed directly on quarries is the Annunciation,
which dates from 1350, in the south choir aisle,
but it is not a very interesting group. The chapel
of St. Piat contains some glass of the latter half
of the century, but the treatment it has received
prevents one forming an opinion of it.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Evreux.</p>

<p>The Cathedral of Evreux is rich in remains of
fourteenth century glass, which, like that at
York, illustrates the progress of design during
the century, the windows being of all dates from
the opening of the fourteenth century till well on
in the fifteenth. The earliest are those in the
choir chapels, some of which are of about the
same date as the Merton College glass, which,
indeed, they at once call to mind. As at Merton,
small coloured panels containing figures under low
canopies are made to decorate long lights of
grisaille. For the most part, as at Merton, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
figures consist of donors in the outer lights,
kneeling to their patron saints in the inner ones,
though occasionally one finds subjects, such as
the part of a Life of St. Martin in one of the
northern chapels. One of the chapels in the apse
is remarkable for the charming use of heraldry
in the border. The windows contain figures of
the Count of Evreux kneeling to the Virgin. His
arms are the lilies of France with a bend "componée"
of argent and gules, and the fleur-de-lis
and the bend are repeated alternately all the way
up the border, on a ground of blue, with delightful
effect.</p>

<p>Later than these is the Harcourt window, the
earliest apparently of those in the clerestory, which
must date from between 1310 and 1327, though
I am inclined to think it is nearer the later date.
Here again one has the arrangement, so characteristic
of the fourteenth century, of kneeling donors
in the outer lights and their patron saints in the
inner,&mdash;the first idea in nearly every fourteenth
century window is the safety of the donor's soul,&mdash;but
here the coloured panels are placed at the
very bottom of the window, with grisaille above,
an arrangement which one finds again in later
work at Rouen. It has the advantage of bringing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
the figures nearer the eye, but as a design it is
hardly happy.</p>

<p class="sidenote">St. Ouen at
Rouen.</p>

<p>The fine church of St. Ouen at Rouen is very
rich in fourteenth century glass of the first half
of the century. The oldest, perhaps, is in the
clerestory windows, which afford another example
of the practice found, I think, earlier in France
than in England, of placing figures directly on a
background of quarries (<a href="#i243">Plate XXIV.</a>). From the
small amount of stain used I do not think they
are likely to be later than 1330, though the queer
little pedestal with its ogival arch does not look a
very early feature.</p>

<p>Rather later than these are the immense
windows in the choir aisles, of which <a href="#i253">Plate XXV.</a>
is an example. In comparing them to those in
York Minster, they seem to me to come, in
point of development, between the aisle windows
of the nave and the west windows, but are far
better than the latter; yet, although there is
hardly a detail in them which cannot be found
in an earlier form at Merton College or York,
they have, nevertheless, a character all their own,
a hint of growing divergence between the two
schools. The subject of this particular window
is the Life of St. Gervais, but it is such an unimportant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
detail in the design as to be hardly
worth mentioning, the real interest of the windows
being their planning and ornament. They are
planned on precisely the same system as the
windows in Merton College chapel, in the choir
chapels at Evreux, and the aisles of York nave,
but the canopies are more highly developed, the
quarries are "true" quarries, and stain is much
more freely used. Plates <a href="#i259">XXVI.</a>-<a href="#i295">XXX.</a> show,
in detail, the use that has been made of it in the
grisaille borders and bosses of this window. Even
the canopies that are all yellow are, I fancy,
coloured with stain; but the artist has been alive
to the danger of too much yellow in the window,
and has made every other canopy white, merely
touched with stain, a form which in time was
to supersede the other altogether. If you compare
the little figure from one of these canopies
in <a href="#i295">Plate XXX.</a> with the little border figures from
Peter de Dene's window at York, you will see
how the work is beginning to lose the mosaic
character it had inherited from the previous centuries.
The grisaille patterns, as well as the
borders, show descent from, or at least common
origin with, those of York and Merton&mdash;you
can find that central stem with a wavy line on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
it in both; but there is a subtle difference in
the Rouen work&mdash;a little more grace, and more
care that the foliage shall not only decorate the
whole space of white, but form a symmetrical
pattern on each individual quarry, a tendency
which, however, may also be found in English work
towards the end of the century.</p>

<p>Of later fourteenth century work there is not
very much in France. The country was devastated
by war, and there can have been little money
or heart left for painted windows. Whichever
side of the channel the style of the early fourteenth
century originated, it is quite certain that
the next great movement came from England.

<h2 class="p6">XII<br />

LATE FOURTEENTH CENTURY GLASS<br />
IN ENGLAND<br />
<br />
(TRANSITIONAL&mdash;GLOUCESTER AND THE WORK<br />
OF THE WINCHESTER SCHOOL)</h2>

<p>An interesting thing about the design of stained
glass in the fourteenth century is that it never
stands still, but changes more rapidly than at
any other period in its history. At Gloucester,
not more than from ten to twenty years after
the latest of the windows I have been describing,
the great east window of the Cathedral was filled
with glass, which already faintly foreshadows the
change into the style of the succeeding period.</p>

<p>The Severn valley is rich in glass of the fourteenth
century, the work of a school which may
have had its headquarters at Gloucester, where,
in later times, at all events, there were important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
glass-works, which may still be seen in seventeenth
century views of the city.</p>

<p>The fourteenth century glass at Shrewsbury,
Tewkesbury, and Wells is all of this school, and
differs in many little ways from the work at York,
among which are the frequency of the ogival arch
and gable in the canopies, and, at Wells, the
presence of foliated brackets which support the
figures. Whether the work in Bristol Cathedral
also belongs to it I am not quite prepared to
say.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The east
window of
Gloucester
Cathedral.</p>

<p>I have no space, however, to describe these
windows, and must return to the east window of
Gloucester Cathedral which is later in style than
any of them. Winston, who has given it the same
careful study that he had devoted to the Peter de
Dene window at York, points out that the coats of
arms in it are all those of nobles who took part in
the Campaign of Crècy in 1346 and deduces that
the date of the window is not later than 1350,
whereas Westlake thinks it cannot be earlier than
1360. In either case it is remarkable. To begin
with, the tracery of this immense window, the
second largest in England, is pure Perpendicular,
and the earliest important example of it. The glass,
on the other hand, in its architectural detail, style
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
of drawing, and material used, belongs almost
wholly to the Second or Decorated Period, and it
is mainly in its planning and general colour scheme
that we find a hint of approaching change. The
perpendicular mullions and horizontal transoms
divide the great window, which is slightly bowed
outwards to give its strength, into a series of
horizontal rows of narrow lights one above the
other, fourteen lights in a row, each light being
about two feet wide and from six to nine feet high.
The lower tiers (and originally this was true of the
tracery as well) are filled with quarries, and the
upper one of these, the first that extends all across
the window,&mdash;for the entrance to the Lady Chapel
makes a gap below it,&mdash;is decorated with the
splendid row of coats of arms already mentioned.
Above this each light, row upon row, contains a
figure under a canopy, the side shafts of which
extend into the light above and support the canopy
there, while the central pinnacle also extends
upwards past the transom and expands into a flat-topped
pedestal which carries the figure above.
Figure and canopy are white, their whiteness only
emphasised by touches of yellow stain, and relieved
against a coloured background. The background
of the two central columns of lights is ruby, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
of the column on each side blue, and the next ruby
again and so on alternately. Thus the general
effect is of a white pattern on a background that is
striped vertically with alternate red and blue. It
is this simple but effective colour scheme that
gives the window its resemblance in effect to
Perpendicular glass; but there are other features&mdash;the
complete absence of borders, the pedestals that
carry the figures (which are first found at Wells),
and the decoration of the quarries&mdash;which all indicate
the coming change. The quarries, where the
original ones remain, still have the "trellis" pattern,
but instead of the continuous flowing pattern of
foliage running through them each quarry has a
sort of star pattern in the middle of it, stained
yellow, a design much more common in the
fifteenth than in the fourteenth century. This
placing of quarries at the foot of the windows and
in the tracery has its origin, of course, in the old
fourteenth century arrangement of a horizontal
stripe or stripes of figure and canopy work on a
ground of grisaille.</p>

</div>

<p>The subject of the window is the enthronement
of the virgin surrounded by apostles, saints, and
angels; the same subject as that of the west
window of York Minster which it was probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
meant to, and certainly does, surpass. The figures
themselves, however, still suffer from the conventionality
and affectation of the period, and it was
not for twenty years more that there was to be a
change in that quarter as well.</p>

<p class="sidenote">William of
Wykeham
and Thomas
the Glazier.</p>

<p>It was in 1380, or soon after, that new life came
into the art through the piety and enterprise of
William of Wykeham, whose influence may be
compared to that of Abbot Suger in the twelfth
century, and the genius of his master glazier,
Thomas. Of the latter we only know his name
from the portrait of himself which he put in the
windows of Winchester College Chapel (now, alas!
only modern copies of the originals), with the
inscription "Thomas operator ist. vitri," but his
hand is easily recognizable not only at Winchester,
and in the three original lights from thence now in
South Kensington Museum, but in the glorious set
of windows in the antechapel of New College at
Oxford.</p>

<p class="sidenote">New College
antechapel.</p>

<p>There had been no such work as this last done
since the best days of the thirteenth century.
Here, once again, one finds the art used as a means
of emotional expression not only in the deep and
solemn harmonies of colour that strike one with a
thrill on entering the building, but in the treatment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
of the subjects themselves, in which the
artist breaks completely away from the conventionalism
of the preceding period.</p>

<p>The antechapel of New College, a graceful
piece of Early Perpendicular, is really, like that at
Merton, a cross transept at the west end of the
Chapel, forming a <b>T</b> of which the antechapel is
the head, having windows on all its four sides&mdash;two
on the east, on either side of the entrance to
the Chapel proper, two on the north, one on the
south, and three on the west. The glass of the
great central west window was taken out to make
room for Jervais' smudgy rendering in muddy
browns and yellows of Sir Joshua Reynolds' famous
Virtues. I am not concerned with this but with
the other windows, which contain, though some of
the lights are evidently out of their order, the
original glazing which William of Wykeham
placed here when he built the Chapel, between
1380 and 1386.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
canopies.</p>

<p>The design of the windows is a very simple one.
The horizontal transom divides each window into
two equal tiers of four, or, in the eastern windows,
six, lights with tracery above. Each light is filled
with a figure standing on a pedestal and under a
canopy, both canopy and pedestal being white,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
enriched with touches of yellow stain, relieved
against a background which is, or was, blue and
red in alternate lights, the colour of the background
inside the canopy being counterchanged with the
colour outside. From this arrangement and from
the presence of the pedestal I think the artist had
seen both Wells and the east windows of Gloucester
Cathedral, but the architecture of his canopies is of
a fantastic kind peculiar to this school and unlike
anything in glass of the styles which preceded and
followed it, but based to some extent on the stone
canopies of the late fourteenth century, such as
those on the screen of the west front of Exeter
Cathedral. The most noticeable feature in them is
the number of queer rounded turrets with pepper-box
tops, modelled in relief. Indeed for their
solidity, as well as for their violent and untrue
perspective, these canopies have more in common
with those introduced at Fairford a hundred years
later, when the continental influence was coming
in, than with the typical canopy of English Perpendicular.</p>

<p>From the large amount of space that is occupied
by the canopy work, the general effect of these
windows is rather a white one (though white in all old
work is a relative term, the white in this case consisting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
really of a delicate play of greenish, yellowish,
and pure white continually contrasted), and the most
beautiful to my mind are those in which, as in the
windows on the north side which face one on
entering, the figures themselves are almost entirely
covered with a coloured mantle which makes a
broad splash of distinctive colour in the middle of
each light.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The eastern
windows.</p>

<p>Although all the windows conform to the same
general design, those on the east side, on each side of
the entrance to the Chapel proper, seem to me to
be by a different hand, and were probably done
first. They contain or contained originally no
colours but red and blue, and the drawing of the
figures has much of the conventionalism of the
earlier fourteenth century work. The upper tier
consists of the twelve apostles, and the lower is
believed to have contained the figure of the
crucified Christ with His mother and St. John on
either side, repeated four times. The figures of
Christ have all been destroyed and replaced by
figures from elsewhere, perhaps from the destroyed
west window; but three figures of the Virgin and
three of St. John remain, though it was only in
1900 that they were replaced in what I have little
doubt were their original positions. It may, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
course, be that these windows are by the same
artist as the others, but done before he had quite
found himself or emancipated himself from the
conventionalities of his predecessors, for he has
infused a certain amount of life into the old forms;
and the "Mater Dolorosa," in spite of her conventional
S-like pose, is a tender and pathetic figure.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
colouring.</p>

<p>There is, however, no trace of this conventionality
in the other windows, quaint though the
drawing may be, and in the colour of them the
artist has fairly "let himself go." I know of no
better piece of "colour music" in the world than
is afforded by the double tier of prophets and
patriarchs which occupy the two northern windows
which face one on entering&mdash;deep rich purple of
many shades, warm green, slaty-blue, brown, and a
splendid blood-red ruby with a great deal of variety
in it; the changes are rung on these in the mantles,
hats, and shoes of the figures, while the reds and
blues of the backgrounds form a connecting link
between them all. A pretty detail is the
powdering of the backgrounds to the figures in all
the windows with the initials of the personage
represented, in white Lombardic letters surmounted
by little gold crowns. The drawing is, I admit,
quaint,&mdash;Thomas was not a great draughtsman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
even for his time; far from it,&mdash;but it is always big,
masculine, and expressive, with a strong feeling for
decorative line. To copy the scrolls which twist
and flutter round the prophets in the upper tier is
in itself a lesson in design.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Eve.</p>

<p>Perhaps nowhere is his originality of conception
so well shown as in the figure of Eve, in the
northern west window. Instead of representing
her, as nearly every other artist has done to the
best of his ability, as a graceful nude, he has given
us a peasant woman of his own time, spinning with
a distaff and spindle. I do not know that he has
even tried to make her pretty, and in the simple
drawing of the folds of her colourless dress he has
managed to suggest that it is of coarse thick stuff.
She is neither nymph nor princess but the sharer
of man's daily drudgery. In looking at her one
is unavoidably reminded of the lines which Wat
Tyler's followers had sung only a year or two
before:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>When Adam delved and Eve span,</p>
<p>Who was then the gentleman?</p>
</div></div>

<p>The little upright tracery lights are filled with
angels, but in the summit of the northern east
window is a small figure of William of Wykeham
kneeling before his Saviour, who shows His wounds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
This and the mutilated inscription at the base of
each light, "Orate pro Willelmo de Wykeham,
Episcopo Wynton, fundatore istius collegii," is all
there is to tell of the donor. There was a new
spirit abroad; no longer were the portrait and arms
of the patron allowed to usurp half, or, as at
Tewkesbury, the whole of a church window, nor in
England, at all events till the end of the fifteenth
century, was the practice again revived to quite the
same extent.</p>

<p>These windows mark the second of the great
periodic impulses in stained glass, which I spoke of
at the beginning of the book. Only the second, I
consider, for though there had been many changes
in style since the twelfth century, each had meant,
on the whole, a loss of beauty rather than a gain,
whereas now we find a sudden infusion of new life
into the art, which did not in England lose its force
for fifty or sixty years to come, and produced a new
style, the style of the Third Period. To me these
windows are one of the great art treasures of the
world, yet as I lately sat there all through a long
spring afternoon, party after party of visitors, many
of them people educated enough, one would think,
to know better, came in to gaze awe-struck at Sir
Joshua's muddy brown Virtues, and left without a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
glance at the glorious colour harmonies which
surrounded them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Winchester
College.</p>

<p>Of other work of Thomas the Glazier and his
school&mdash;the Winchester school, as Mr. Westlake
calls it&mdash;little but fragments remain, unless one
counts a window in the south aisle of the Lady Chapel
of York Minster, the third from the east, which
somewhat resembles their work and represents just
about the same stage in development. William of
Wykeham's next great work was the founding of
Winchester College in 1387, and in what remains
of its glass the hand of Thomas can be clearly seen.
But, alas! in the early nineteenth century they
took out the old glass and substituted modern
copies; it was their method of restoration in those
days. The old glass seems to have been the
perquisite of the glazier, and three of the lights,
after various peregrinations,&mdash;spending eight years
in a window of St. Mary's, Shrewsbury,&mdash;have
found their way to South Kensington Museum
where they may still be seen. In style they are
very like the north, west, and south windows at
New College, and quite obviously by the same
hand, though perhaps the canopies, at least in one
case, show a very slight progress towards the regular
Perpendicular type. The material seems to me much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
the same as at New College, but for some reason the
coloured glass is much more pitted by the weather
and consequently obscured, though the white, perhaps
from a different shop, is in splendid preservation.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Winchester
Cathedral.</p>

<p>The great west window of Winchester Cathedral
contains fragments and a few whole figures of very
similar work, and there are others in the side windows
of the nave. William of Wykeham's will, made in
1403, leaves money for the glazing of the Cathedral
windows "beginning from the west at the first window
of the new work done by him," which sounds as if
the west end had been already glazed. Indeed the
fragments there are more like the eastern windows
(the earliest, if I am right) in New College antechapel,
while in the fragments that remain in the side
windows of the nave the later hand can be traced,
though the tendency in the canopies of these is to
assimilate gradually to the regular Perpendicular type
which by this time had been developed elsewhere.</p>

<p>Winston thinks the west window of the
Cathedral may have been glazed in the time
of William of Wykeham's predecessor, Bishop
Edington, in which case it is not unlikely that it and
the east windows of the antechapel at New College
were the work of Thomas's master, whose style was
further developed and improved by Thomas himself.

THE STYLE OF THE THIRD PERIOD</h2>

<p class="sidenote">Divergence
between
English and
French
schools.</p>

<p>A notable feature of the fifteenth century is the
divergence which takes place in it between the
styles of English and French stained glass.
Although in some respects they develop along
parallel lines the two no longer form, as they did
almost to the end of the fourteenth century, one
school. The Hundred Years' War has done its
work, and produced a separation of spirit for which
the world has, perhaps, been the poorer ever since.</p>

<p>Indeed for the first half of the fifteenth century,
during which the best of the English work was
done, the quantity of stained glass produced in
France seems to have been almost negligible, and
a comparison of the conditions of the two countries
is a sufficient explanation of this fact. While
England was becoming rich and prosperous and
developing her foreign trade, France was laid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
waste by war and struggling to free herself from the
foreigner who had beaten her down. It was not
till the English had been finally expelled, and
France had emerged from the struggle a stronger
State than she had ever been before, that the art
revived; and when it did so it owed little, as is not
surprising, to English influence, but on the other
hand began to feel, almost at once, the influence of
the Continental schools of painting.</p>

<p>In England, on the other hand, in spite of the
quarrels of the nobles and the rival claimants to
the throne, the middle class were steadily growing
wealthy and powerful. The wool trade was bringing
a great deal of money into the country, and the
result is still seen not only in the number and size
of Perpendicular churches that were built, but in
the immense output of stained glass that took
place. The fifteenth century, indeed, was by far
the most prolific period in the history of English
stained glass, and, in spite of four hundred years
of destruction, vast quantities of it still remain.</p>

<p class="sidenote">General

<p class="p2">(1) <i>The Type of Canopy.</i>&mdash;Although in the
fifteenth, as in the fourteenth century, figures were
occasionally placed directly on a background of
white quarries, as may be seen at York, in the
clerestory of St. Martin's-le-Grand, and in the
transepts of the Minster, the fifteenth century
artists showed no signs of wishing to abandon the
canopy.</p>

<p>It was a curious freak of fate that imposed the
canopy upon stained-glass designers and made it a
<i>sine quâ non</i> for two hundred years. It has certain
obvious advantages, it is true. It conveniently
filled the head of the light, and its upright lines and
pinnacles repeated those of the surrounding architecture
and made the window part of it; but the
imitation of a stone niche in glass is hard to justify
on abstract grounds, and it is difficult now to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
understand the enthusiasm which, as soon as it was
introduced, made its adoption so universal that,
with few exceptions, the artists of the day seemed
unable to conceive of a single figure or a set of
subject panels otherwise than surmounted by a
bewildering mass of crockets and pinnacles. It is
true that in the hands of mediæval craftsmen, in
England at least, there was no attempt, as there
was later, at literal imitation of stone-work; the
canopy was rather ornament with an architectural
motif, and as such possessed beauty; but I cannot
help thinking that if they had never adopted it
they would have evolved some other ornamental
form which, while serving the same purposes, would
have been more strictly in accordance with the
rules of sound art, and might have given more
room for the play of individual fancy.</p>

</div>
<p>Though, however, the English fifteenth century
craftsmen did not abandon the canopy, they profoundly
modified it and made it far more pliant and
adaptable. Plates <a href="#i331">XXXIV.</a> and <a href="#i343">XXXV.</a> from
York will give a better idea of the canopies of the
early fifteenth century than any description. It
will be seen that the single overpowering crocketted
gable and wall-sided tower of the fourteenth
century has disappeared, and in its place we have a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
froth of pinnacles, windows, buttresses and niches
all in white and yellow stain, on a background of
colour. The earlier attempt at modelling the
canopies in the round, which is seen in the work of
the Winchester school, had been abandoned, and
although every little shaft has its light and dark
side delicately distinguished, this counts for little
except to diversify the surface, the forms being
expressed principally in strong and simple outline.
The extent to which this simplification of outline
was carried may be seen in the little crocketted
pinnacles, such as those at the bottom of <a href="#i331">Plate XXXIV.</a>,
which are characteristic of all English
work of the time. There is, as you may see, no
attempt to draw or model the foliation of the
crockets, which are simply knobs outlined in the
flat with a thick black line. This method is the
salvation of English Perpendicular work, and
shows the thorough understanding on the part of
our craftsmen of the technical problem. In French
work later on in the century, and in much modern
pseudo-Gothic work, the attempt is made to express
the canopy work in fine lines and delicate
modelling, which, in the result, appears confused
and indistinct, and too weak for the leading and
for the coloured figure work it encloses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">The skilful
use of silver
stain.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Increased Amount of White used.</i>&mdash;Not
only is the canopy white, but there is also as a rule
a good deal of white in the figures within it, which
are generally relieved against a diapered flat background
of colour. Just one figure at New College
has the brown-pink flesh colour, and that is its last
appearance. Everywhere else one finds white used,
the hair, in the case of women and young men,
being stained yellow. This large increase in the use
of white glass was accompanied, and indeed made
possible, by a most delicate and skilful use of the
yellow silver stain. This operation, of all others
in stained-glass work, calls for the greatest exercise
of taste and judgment as well as skill on the part
of the craftsman,&mdash;<i>experto crede</i>,&mdash;and in its use
the English workers of the first three-quarters of
the fifteenth century stand unrivalled.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Loss of
mosaic
character.</p>

<p>This use of white in the figures and canopies
rendered unnecessary the old fourteenth century
plan of dividing the window up into alternate
panels of grisaille and colour, and this is abandoned.
Another result is the loss of the essentially mosaic
character of the older windows. So much could
now be expressed with stain and brown enamel on
one piece of glass that, although the pieces used
were still comparatively small, it was no longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
necessary to surround every form with a lead as
a matter of course. <a href="#i351">Plate XXXVI.</a> is a good
instance of this. The green-striped background to
the figures is the work of the restorer and was
probably once blue, as in <a href="#i359">Plate XXXVII.</a>, and
this and the red mantle surcoat and shield are the
only forms that it was absolutely necessary to lead
in separately. It is true that, either for emphasis
or from habit, the artist has outlined the man's
knees in lead; but he need not have done so, and it
would indeed have been easier not to. In the next
plate (<a href="#i359">Plate XXXVII.</a>) the leading on the white
takes very little account of the drawing.</p>

<p>Out of these conditions then arose a wholly new
attitude towards the leading. Hitherto the disposition
of the lead-work had followed naturally and
inevitably from the design&mdash;the artist drew in lead,
so to speak, merely supplementing it with the finer
painted line; whereas now the leads had, in part
at least, to be so arranged as not to interfere with
the drawing, or only to emphasize it when needed,
a matter requiring much more thought. A comparison
of either of the above plates with <a href="#i053">Plate IV.</a>
will illustrate the difference. Hence we find a
gradual tendency to use larger pieces of glass and
fewer leads (the latter being sometimes concealed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
behind the iron-work), till by the end of the
century the jewel-like quality of the early glass is
a thing wholly lost and forgotten.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The method
of drawing.<br />
<br />
Matt
shading.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The more Advanced Style of Drawing.</i>&mdash;The
older conventions in drawing had, as we have seen,
become outgrown and abandoned, and all through
the last part of the fourteenth century there is a
steady struggle for a more advanced method of
expression. At the beginning of the fifteenth
century, drawing, in England at least, crystallized
once more into a convention satisfying to the mind
of the time, which left the artist free to tell his
story. Plates <a href="#i379">XXXIX.</a> to <a href="#i411">XLIII.</a> are examples
of it as found at York, and <a href="#i419">Plate XLIV.</a> from
Canterbury does not greatly differ in method.
The drawing still depends chiefly on line work, but
the line work is far finer than before and is used
to express modelling with the help of the matt
shading. This last is the form of shading which
has survived to modern times, and is done by laying
a flat semi-transparent coat or "matt" of enamel
over the whole surface of the glass, and, when it is
dry, and before it is fired, brushing out graduated
lights and half tones with a small stiff hog's-hair
brush. Sometimes, but not always, the matt was
stippled when wet, as may be seen in <a href="#i403">Plate XLII.</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
In later times the matt shading was, and sometimes
still is, abused in the attempt to give
modelling in high relief by its means alone, a
method which results in the loading of the glass
with opaque muddy brown, while the modelling
becomes untrue with changing lights. This, however,
was hardly done within the limits of the
period I am writing about in this book, in which
the drawing of form is still principally dependent
on line work, and is merely helped and softened
with the matt.</p>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">The type of
figure.</p>

<p>The figures themselves in contrast to those of
the previous period are rather short and ungraceful,
but, in the best work at least, very much alive.
The quaint nose of which <a href="#i403">Plate XLII.</a> is an
extreme type is curiously universal throughout
English work of the time, and was, I suppose, the
accepted type of beauty.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Forms used
in the
ornament.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The Abandonment of Natural Plant Forms
in Ornament.</i>&mdash;The natural plant forms, which were
so universally used in fourteenth century ornament,
were abruptly abandoned at the beginning of the
fifteenth. Their place is taken, in the diapered
backgrounds to the figures, by a curious long
serrated leaf, rather like certain kinds of seaweed,
which may be seen in Plates <a href="#i359">XXXVII.</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
<a href="#i371">XXXVIII.</a> Borders become less frequent, and
when they occur generally consist of a leaf of
something the same sort, in white and stain,
wrapping round a central stem, sometimes with
and sometimes without a coloured background.
Later on, the conventional pomegranate pattern is
occasionally introduced in vestments and hangings,
but it is the exception for coloured garments to
be ornamented except with an edging. White
garments are sometimes powdered with little
devices in yellow stain, as in <a href="#i379">Plate XXXIX.</a>
The edgings to bishops' copes are often of white
set with coloured jewels, which are sometimes let
into the middle of a piece of glass without its
being cut across&mdash;a <i>tour de force</i> of glazing very
difficult to accomplish and not worth the trouble
when done.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Supersession of Other Forms of Grisaille by
Regular Quarries.</i>&mdash;The "bulged" quarries disappear
by the middle of the fourteenth century
and the ordinary straight-sided, diamond-shaped
quarry is henceforth the rule. By the end of
the century the continuous flowing pattern running
through them is abandoned also. There had been
a tendency towards the end, as may be seen in
<a href="#i259">Plate XXVI.</a>, for the pattern to be so disposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
that a flower, or other feature, was repeated in the
middle of each quarry&mdash;in a transitional window
at York, which I have referred to elsewhere, there
is a continuous pattern with a bird in the centre
of each quarry perching upon a branch of it. In
the fifteenth century the connecting pattern was
left out, and quarries are decorated solely by a
little device in the centre of each. Sometimes
these are purely conventional, but often they are
the occasion for delightful exercise of fancy on
the artist's part and form an exception to the
general rule of the disuse of natural ornament.
Birds, insects, flowers, and leaves are used, as well
as heraldic devices and monograms, all expressed
very simply in firm pure line work touched with
the yellow stain.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The change
in material.<br />
<br />
Flashed
ruby.</p>

<p>(6) <i>The Material used.</i>&mdash;At the beginning of
the fifteenth century there is a very marked change
in the material used. It becomes thinner and
flatter&mdash;sometimes very thin indeed&mdash;and the
colour is more even. Thirteenth century "ruby,"
seen edgeways, reveals itself as composed, for nearly,
if not quite, half its thickness, of alternate minute
layers of red and white, the rest of the thickness
being white. It has been thought that to this
is due the wonderful luminous quality of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
early ruby. Gradually the number of these layers
are reduced till at the beginning of the fifteenth
century the red is all concentrated into one layer
on the surface. This is the "flashed" glass referred
to at the beginning of the book, and one soon
begins to find instances of ornament chipped out
of it. The lion on the red shield in <a href="#i351">Plate XXXVI.</a>
has, I think, been got in this way, and a later
instance may be seen in <a href="#i471">Plate L.</a> in the girdle
of the prophet Hosea on the right.</p>

<p>The rich blues of earlier times are replaced by a
more sober greyish blue, which, however, is a very
effective colour in glass. The colours are not
perfectly flat tints, for there are gradations in
them, but the streaky, crumbly quality of the
early glass is gone. The craftsman was beginning
to rely for quality less on the glass itself than on
what he put on it.

<h2 class="p6">XIV<br />

FIFTEENTH CENTURY GLASS<br />
AT YORK</h2>

<p>The very well-defined and distinctive style I have
described, which became universal in English fifteenth
century work, and which, from the architecture
with which it is associated, we call Perpendicular,
was not, I think, evolved by the Winchester School,
although no doubt they influenced it. Where it
began must always be something of a mystery, but
some work in the east window of Exeter Cathedral
is very suggestive in this connection.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Lyen's work
at Exeter.</p>

<p>This window, glazed originally at the beginning
of the fourteenth century, was enlarged and rebuilt
with Perpendicular tracery in 1390-91 through
the munificence of one of the canons, Henry Blakeborn;
and in 1392 Robert Lyen, glazier, citizen of
Exeter, and master glazier to the Cathedral, was
commissioned to adapt the old glass to its new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
setting, adding what was necessary of his own
work to fill the space. Robert Lyen's work is
easily to be distinguished from the earlier work
(which, besides that of 1302, includes four figures
of about 1340-50, which he may have brought from
other windows to fill up with). It consists of six
figures, of which only three are under canopies of
Lyen's time, and of a row, across the bottom, of
short double-arched canopies enclosing coats of
arms of past bishops of Exeter. The drawing is
about equal to that of the Winchester School, but
the canopies, with their multitude of crocketted
pinnacles in strong outline, are far nearer to the
regular Perpendicular type, such as we find at
York, than anything that was being done by the
Winchester School at that date.</p>

<p>Was the work of Robert Lyen an example of a
style which had become general throughout the
west, and of which the influence extended as far as
Coventry? For in 1405 John Thornton of Coventry
was commissioned to fill with stained glass the
huge east windows of the new choir of York
Minster, and this is the earliest existing window,
of which the date is known, in which the Perpendicular
style in glass has taken definite form.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i411" id="i411"></a>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">The east
window of
York
Minster.</p>

<p>This great window is the glory of English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
stained glass. It is 78 feet high from top to
bottom, and below the great mass of Perpendicular
tracery, which fills the mighty pointed
arch of it, there are the three tiers of lower lights
divided by horizontal transoms, with nine lights
in every tier. Each of these lights measures 3
feet 6 inches across, and is divided again by the
thick iron frame-bars into roughly square panels,
each of which contains a subject from the Bible.
The canopy work which, in the hands of a fourteenth
century artist, would have filled half the
window space with its towering spires, is here reduced
to a small many-pinnacled canopy just filling
the head of each light (where it would have been
an awkward shape for a subject), a narrow shafting
forming a border down the side, and a very shallow
flat arch dividing each subject from the one above.
There has been no question here of eking out a
poverty of ideas; on the contrary, the artist's aim
seems rather to have been to get as much space as
possible for the expression of them.</p>

<p>There are one hundred and seventeen of these
subject panels. Thornton would seem to have
begun at the top with the idea of telling the whole
story of the Old Testament, or perhaps that of the
entire Bible, but by the time he had finished the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
upper tier, which contains three rows of panels, as
compared with five in each tier below, and carried
the story as far as the death of Absalom, he, or
more probably his clients, seem to have changed
their minds, for the rest of the window, with the
exception of the bottom row panels, is devoted to
the illustration of the Apocalypse, beginning with
the torture of St. John under Domitian and his
banishment to Patmos.</p>

<p>John Thornton was a greater draughtsman than
Thomas of Winchester, and the portrayal of these
scenes is far in advance, from the pictorial point of
view, of anything that had been done in glass up
to that time. Here again one feels, as in the best
days of the Early Period, that one can take pleasure
in the actual technique of the painting, but it is
a different technique to that of the Early Period.
The line work is still wonderfully precise and expressive,
but it is more delicate than before, and is
helped by delicate modelling in "matt shading,"
while the drawing itself is in a much more modern
convention. It is, indeed, the first example in
stained glass of a style of drawing which was to
hold the field in England till nearly the end of
the century, and to John Thornton is due, probably,
the credit of its introduction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Its colouring.</p>

<p>As a colourist, however, John Thornton is even
greater. This window stands almost alone in
England, if not in Europe, for the way in which
colour is made use of as a means of expression.
Elsewhere in York the successors of John Thornton
seem to have been content with a merely decorative
distribution of red, blue, and silver stain in their
subjects, but here each scene has its appropriate
colour scheme, the creation of fishes, for instance,
being a lovely harmony of blue and silvery white,
while the scenes in Eden are a glory of spring-like
greens and gold.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Its con&shy;struction.</p>

<p>The necessary element of strength in the construction
of this huge window, which, at Gloucester
was, as we have seen, obtained by building the
whole window on the plan of a bow, is here
provided by doubling the mullions below the
second transom. An inner set has been constructed
between three and four feet on the inside
of those which sustain the glass, being connected
with them by little flying arches and so acting as
buttresses to them. This double set of mullions
carries a gallery along its top at the level of the
upper transom, while another runs across the base
of the window, and from these it is possible to
study the upper and lower tiers of lights at close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
quarters. Unfortunately access to these galleries is
nowadays only granted as a great favour, but for
those that can obtain it, it is well worth the
trouble, for it is only from this position that the
pages of this vast picture-book can be studied, and
its story unravelled. Indeed I think the only
adverse criticism that can be made of John
Thornton's work is to question the artistic wisdom
of putting so much beautiful work, on such a small
scale,&mdash;for the delicate drawing and finish of the
work is wonderful,&mdash;in a position in which it was
invisible to the ordinary observer below. Perhaps
John Thornton did not realize how small his panels
would look,&mdash;panels three and a half feet square
seem a fair size when you are working at them,&mdash;and
no doubt access to the galleries was freer then
than now; but a thirteenth century artist would
not have made the mistake.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p class="caption">PLATE XLIV<br />

</div>

<p>Yet the architectural effect of the whole is little,
if at all, the worse for it. The smallness of the
panels only increases one's sense of the size of the
window and gives the glass a jewel-like quality.
It is all a twinkle of beautiful colour. Neither
have the repairs effected by the eighteenth century
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
glaziers hurt it much&mdash;pieces of clear coloured
glass put in to fill up holes, and on which the
glazier has usually scratched his name and the date
with his diamond. Rather, I think, these tiny
touches of pure colour (for they used quite a good
blue) add to it and give it a quality.</p>

<p>What does detract from its beauty is the dirty
quarry glazing which has been put outside it to
protect it. Beautiful as the window still is, quite
a third of its beauty of light and colour has been
sacrificed by this means.</p>

<p class="sidenote">A transitional
window.</p>

<p>There is some glass in the Lady Chapel which
seems older than the east window. I have
already alluded to the third window from the
east in the south aisle which represents a stage
of development corresponding to the earlier work
of the Winchester School in the west window of
Winchester Cathedral and the east windows of
New College antechapel. The three lights contain
three figures, St. Edward the Confessor between
St. James and St. John the Evangelist, unless the
former figure is also St. John appearing to the king
as a pilgrim, as in the well-known story. Below are
small scenes of the Massacre of the Innocents, Christ
among the Doctors, and the Baptism in Jordan.
The figures still have something of the S-like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
curve of the fourteenth century, but the canopies
are white and of the transitional type. Perhaps the
most interesting things in the window are the quarry
panels at the bottom, which have a continuous flowing
pattern of oak foliage running through the
quarries, but with birds perching on it, so arranged
that a bird comes in the centre of each quarry.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Thornton's
successors.</p>

<p>There is some similar glass to this in the
clerestory, but, with this exception and that of a
fourteenth century window in the south aisle
which has evidently been moved from the nave,
the rest of the glass in the choir and Lady Chapel
is the work of the school which was either founded
by John Thornton at York, or at least profoundly
influenced by him. It seems probable to me that
it was in their work, which is found not only in
the Cathedral but also in most of the parish
churches of York, that the Perpendicular style in
glass finally crystallized into the form which, with
minor local differences, became universal throughout
England.</p>

<p>Details from their work may be seen in Plates
<a href="#i331">XXXIV.</a>-<a href="#i411">XLIII.</a> In one respect, namely in
colour, they did not, as I have said, follow John
Thornton, limiting themselves, for some reason
unknown, very much to ruby, blue, and yellow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
stain. <a href="#i371">Plate XXXVIII.</a> is a good instance of
their method (the background of <a href="#i351">Plate XXXVI.</a>,
it must be remembered, is modern). The blue
is of a greyish quality, quite different from that
of early times, but pleasant, and with a good deal
of variety in it; a blue-black was sometimes used,
as in <a href="#i359">Plate XXXVII.</a>, for monks' dresses.</p>

<p class="sidenote">A Jesse Tree.</p>

<p>The only exception to this rule is a window
in the south aisle of the Cathedral choir, which
contains parts of a Jesse Tree, in which the blue
is combined with some very beautiful rich dark
greens and a strong orange stain. Mr. Westlake
thinks the glass is not York work at all. To me
it seems not quite impossible that it is the work
of John Thornton himself, the use of the deep
orange stain in the east window being very similar.
There is, however, no certainty of his authorship
of any existing window but the east window. The
glass in the Guildhall of Coventry is sometimes
claimed for him, but I do not know of any evidence
for it, and as it contains a portrait of Henry VI.
as a grown man it can hardly be much earlier than
1440, thirty-five years later than the east window
at York.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
St. William
and St. Cuthbert
windows.</p>

<p>Next to the great east window, the most
important windows in the choir are those which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
fill the two choir-transepts, and which tell the
histories respectively of St. William of York and
St. Cuthbert. They are only five lights wide, but
extend upwards to the full height of the church,
and have double tracery and galleries like the east
window. Except for their prevailing red and blue
colouring, their general design resembles that of
the east window, the whole window being divided,
in the same way, into a series of small square
subject panels with a short many-pinnacled canopy
just filling the head of each light. The St. Cuthbert
window, however, has, in addition, a life-size
figure of the saint, which occupies two panels in
the middle of the window. The two windows are
evidently by the same hand, but the northern or
St. William window is a good deal the older,
having been presented, as it would seem from the
portraits it contains, by Baron Ros of Hamlake
about 1420, while the St. Cuthbert window cannot
have been given till after 1426, and probably
not till 1430 or later. No doubt, however, the
execution of the first window would occupy a
large part of the intervening time. Of the two,
I rather prefer the effect of the St. William
window, to which the larger amount of dark blue
in the monks' dresses gives greater depth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
richness, but the St. Cuthbert window shows
perhaps more accomplishment in drawing. It is
a fascinating occupation on a bright day to trace,
with the aid of a strong field-glass, the stories
unfolded in these rows upon rows of pictures in
glass, to which a key may be found in monographs
on the two windows, by the Rev. J. T. Fowler and
his brother, published in the <i>Yorkshire Archæological
Journal</i>, vols, iii.-iv.</p>

<p class="sidenote">St. Martin's,
Coney Street.<br />
<br />
All Saints',
North Street.</p>

<p>More easily studied, because nearer to the eye,
are the windows, again by the same hand, in the
churches of St. Martin's, Coney Street, and All
Saints', North Street. The former has a large west
window containing a life-size figure of St. Martin,
surrounded by small scenes from his life, the gift
of a former vicar, Robert Semer, who has most
obligingly recorded the date&mdash;1437&mdash;in an inscription.
This would probably make it just a little
later than the St. Cuthbert window, which its
arrangement resembles. The glass at All Saints'
is particularly interesting. The east window has
three lights with large figures under canopies of
the type shown in Plates <a href="#i331">XXXIV.</a> and <a href="#i343">XXXV.</a>,
which, though elaborate enough, have none of the
unwieldiness of the fourteenth century type and
are properly subordinate to the figures. These are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
St. Peter and St. Christopher (always a favourite
subject in England), and, between them, St. Anne,
teaching the Virgin to read. This last is a very
beautiful group; the Virgin, a graceful girlish
figure in white and yellow stain, with a wreath
of white flowers round her head, is pointing with
a short stick to the letters in a book held by her
mother, who wears a deep ruby mantle over a blue
dress, and a most curious red turban-like headdress<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
with ermine stripes, which is one of the most
striking things in the window.</p>

<p>Below are the donors, Nicholas Blackburn, twice
Mayor of York, and his wife Margaret (<a href="#i351">Plate XXXVI.</a>),
facing his son, also named Nicholas, and
his wife, also named Margaret. The window has
unfortunately been a good deal restored, and the
background to the Blackburns is modern and was,
I should think, originally blue. Modern, too, is
the vivid green of the younger Nicholas's cloak.
Margaret Blackburn, the elder, carries a book with
the words, "Domine, labia mea aperies et os
meum." The same verse occurs also, if I remember
right, in a lady's hand at Selby Abbey.
Were Yorkshire women, one wonders, so very silent?</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>Some of those in the north aisle are designed
on the same plan as the St. William and St.
Cuthbert windows, small subject panels arranged
in rows. One shows the Six Corporal Acts of
Mercy&mdash;Feeding the Hungry, Giving Drink to
the Thirsty, Receiving Strangers, Clothing the
Naked, Visiting the Sick, and Visiting the Prisoners.
The little scenes are full of verve and "go," the
fifteenth century artist having regained much of
the life and vigour which makes the medallions of
the Early Period so delightful, with an even
greater power of expression. <a href="#i379">Plate XXXIX.</a>
represents the Merciful Man visiting the prisoners
in the stocks. I wish Mr. Saint could have found
time to have copied the whole of the scene, of
which the humour is, I feel sure, not unconscious.
Plates <a href="#i359">XXXVII.</a> and <a href="#i371">XXXVIII.</a> are from the
bottom of this window, and show the donor and his
wife with the priest saying mass for them.</p>

<p>Another window illustrates in a number of
scenes the Last Fifteen Days of the World, as
described in Richard Rolle's <i>Pricke of Conscience</i>,
and is well calculated to make the evil-doer take
thought and mend his ways.</p>

FIFTEENTH CENTURY GLASS<br />
IN FRANCE</h2>

<p class="sidenote">The influence
of pictorial
art.</p>

<p>The French school, when it revived in the second
half of the fifteenth century, came, as I have said,
almost at once, and far earlier than the English
school, under the influence of the schools of
painting which had been developed in the Netherlands
(where the Van Eycks were working as early
as 1420), and also, to an extent which has only
been realized comparatively recently, in France
itself.</p>

<p>There was both advantage and disadvantage in
this. The drawing of the French is generally a
little better than our own, and there is more
variety and enterprise in their colour schemes than
in our later Perpendicular work. On the other
hand, it seems to me that almost from the
beginning they were hampered, if ever so little at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
first, by the desire to apply to glasswork the
standards of a different medium.</p>

<p>The difficulty had not arisen before. The
illumination or wall painting of the thirteenth and
early fourteenth century in England and the north
of France could be translated into glass with little
change, but, in the fifteenth century, the painters
of illuminations and panel pictures had learnt all
sorts of things about light and shade and landscape
and flesh painting that did not come at all easily
to the worker in glass and lead, and were of no
help to him in his task of beautifying windows.
It was inevitable that he should make some
attempt to follow in the cry, and the extent to
which he succeeded is amazing; but from henceforth,
even where he most succeeds, it is to some
extent by a <i>tour de force</i>, by a compromise
between incompatibilities.</p>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">Early
fifteenth
century
work.</p>

<p>For the first part of the century, as I have said,
the number of windows produced in France seems
to have been few. Such events as the disaster of
Agincourt, the conquest of France by Henry V.,
and its deliverance by Joan of Arc can have left
little money or thought for stained-glass windows.
The names of the <i>maîtres verriers</i> of the
cathedrals show that all through the time there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
were men who carried on the tradition, but their
output seems to have been small. What windows
they have left us do not show the same complete
change from the work of the previous century
that we find in England; the style did not as
in England crystallize into a definite form, but
remained as a transitional style between that of
the fourteenth and late fifteenth centuries. In
its general outlines the design did not at first differ
greatly from that of the fourteenth century, but, as
in England, the white canopy touched with stain
took the place of all others, and there was a general
increase in the amount of white in windows. In
detail, however, the canopy altered slowly, and it
was never as in England reduced to an almost flat
pattern by the use of strong line work, but persisted
in the attempt to imitate solid stone-work.</p>

<p>It is not till the second half of the century,
when the wars were over, and France had settled
down to quiet reconstruction under Louis XI.,
that we find any great revival of the art, and then
it is very different to contemporary work in
England.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Evreux.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of fifteenth century work
still remaining at Rouen, though there seems to be
a gap in the list of <i>maîtres verriers</i> to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
Cathedral from 1386 to 1426. It was during this
gap, however, in the year 1400, that a window, which
still remains, was placed in the clerestory of the
Cathedral at Evreux. The general plan of this
window is that of those later fourteenth century
windows in which the whole light was filled with
towering canopy work. The canopy differs only
slightly in detail from the late fourteenth century
type, though there is a more decided attempt at
perspective in it, but, like the English work of the
time, it is all white, touched with stain, and the
general effect of the window is much whiter than
that of earlier work. The drawing of the figures,
which represent the donor, Bishop Guillaume de
Cantier, presented to the Virgin by St. Catherine,
does not show any very great change from late
fourteenth century work.</p>

<p class="sidenote">St. Ouen at
Rouen.</p>

<p>The fifteenth century windows at Rouen follow,
for the most part, the general design of the
fourteenth century windows in the same churches.
Thus the window in the chapel of SS. Peter and
Paul in St. Ouen, which Mr. Westlake thinks to be
the work of Guillaume Barbe, 1459-85, has much
the same arrangement and proportions as the
S. Gervais window in the south choir aisle shown
in <a href="#i253">Plate XXV.</a>; that is to say, a small figure panel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
under a big canopy, is set half-way up each tall
light of which the top and bottom is filled with
quarries. There is the same coloured background
to the canopy, ending at the top in the same
arched shape, but in the treatment of the canopy
itself one finds a difference not only from fourteenth
century work but from English work of the fifteenth
century. The French canopy, as I have said, had
never, like the English, been reduced to an almost
flat pattern of intricate line work, and in these
Rouen windows one finds the artist already trying
to imitate stone-work modelled in relief with results
that are heavy and unsatisfactory. It is not that,
in English work, individual shafts are not given a
light and dark side, but the canopy is not, as in
French work, modelled as a solid whole, and the
strong line work seems to keep it right.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
revival.</p>

<p>It was not, however, till the second half of the
century that any new life came into French
stained-glass work, and when it came it brought
with it a skill in picture-making that was borrowed
from contemporary painting. To this period
belong, I think, the fragments from Rouen shown
in Plates <a href="#i427">XLV.</a> to <a href="#i463">XLIX.</a> The heads of St.
Catherine and the old man, if compared with those
from York, show the strong difference in facial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
type between French and English work at this
time. The stain on the hair of St. Catherine is
very coarse and inartistic as compared with English
work, but then no other nation ever equalled the
English in their delicate and refined use of stain.</p>

<p class="sidenote">St. Maclou.</p>

<p>The two heads of Angels (Plates <a href="#i451">XLVIII.</a>,
<a href="#i463">XLIX.</a>), which are from the north transept of
St. Ouen, are, I think, by the same hand as an
interesting "Assumption of the Virgin," which
now occupies two lights of a window in the north
aisle of St. Maclou in the same city. A significant
point about this glass is that the picture, which
is enclosed by a wide, flat-arched canopy, delicately
modelled, stretches right across both lights, completely
ignoring the intervening mullion, one of
the first hints that stained glass was forgetting
its architectural mission.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The composition is
much more ambitious and pictorial, and the
drawing more advanced than in any of the glass
we have hitherto considered. In front is a crowd
of kneeling saints in robes of blue, red, and green,
above whom the Virgin kneels before the Almighty,
while the top of the picture is filled with rows of
golden-haired angels with red wings on a blue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
ground, of a similar type to those illustrated. I should
put the date of the window at about 1470-80.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Lady
Chapel at
Evreux.</p>

<p>Of about the same date are the side windows
of the Lady Chapel of the Cathedral at Evreux,
of which the building was finished, I believe, in
1475. I am surprised that Mr. Westlake, in his
notice of the chapel, only mentions the east window
with its Jesse tree, which to me is much less
beautiful than the others, and which I should be
inclined to attribute, at the earliest, to the very
end of the century, if not to the following one.
The four side windows tell the story of Christ's
Ministry, Passion, and Resurrection, and show His
second coming. Their arrangement is somewhat
English, each window having two tiers of lights,
each of which has a subject enclosed in a white
canopy, but the technique is different from the
English. By far the best is the first window of
the series, which contains eight scenes from the
Ministry of Christ, from the Marriage in Cana
to the Entry into Jerusalem. The canopy work
with its little figures in niches is modelled as Van
Eyck might have done it; the method would not
tell well at a distance, but owing to the narrowness
of the chapel one cannot get far away from these
windows. The figure panels are very rich in colour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Christ being always dressed in a deep purple, and
the other figures in rich greens, blues, and reds.
The other windows of the series are not quite so
good, being thinner and poorer in effect, and seem
to me to have been executed by another hand,
possibly from the designs of the author of the first
window, who may have died in the interval. There
is a good deal of similar work in the church of St.
Taurin in the same town.</p>

<p>From the pictorial point of view these windows
are much more accomplished than anything that
had so far been done in England. In comparing
English and French fifteenth century work, however,
it must always be remembered that the best
English work was done during the first half of the
century, and is far better than the French work of
that time, whereas the best French work was done in
the second half of the century when the English Perpendicular
style had for the most part become stereotyped
and dull, and seemed to resist the introduction
of new ideas. These Evreux windows represent the
style which, under the influence of contemporary
picture-painting, was growing up on the Continent,
but which did not obtain a foothold in England till
the advent, almost at the end of the century, of the
school which produced the Fairford windows.

MALVERN AND FAIRFORD</h2>

<p>So great was the quantity of stained glass produced
in England in the fifteenth century, and so much
still remains, that it is impossible, in this book,
even to mention all the more important examples.
We have seen the growth and perfection of the
Perpendicular style at York. At Great Malvern
Priory you may study its gradual decadence.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Great
Malvern:
the
"Creation."</p>

<p>The best of the windows there are undoubtedly
the earliest, namely, those in St. Anne's Chapel
which include the famous "Creation," of which the
date is perhaps 1440-50. It cannot, I think,
compare with John Thornton's "Creation" in the
east window of York Minster,&mdash;the colour scheme
is so much more conventional and less expressive,&mdash;but
it is nevertheless very beautiful. The
resemblance of some of the scenes to those in
Thornton's window is perhaps no more than one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
would expect to find in two representations of the
same subject in the same period, but at the same
time the Malvern "Creation" is very much akin
to York work, though rather to the later phase
represented by the St. Cuthbert and the All
Saints' windows, than to the work of Thornton.
I may be wrong, but I sometimes suspect that the
inhabitants of the Severn and Avon valleys had
more intercourse with the North of England&mdash;to
which access would be easy by the Avon and
Trent, navigable most of the way&mdash;than with the
Thames Valley and South of England, from which
they were cut off by the wild and inhospitable
Cotswolds.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The north
transept
window.</p>

<p>In comparing the later windows in Malvern
Priory with the "Creation" and its neighbours in
St. Anne's Chapel, one can trace a decided and
increasing decadence. The forms are the same
but stereotyped and dull, the artists seem timid in
their use of colour, and all the life seems to go out
of the style. The great north transept window,
given in 1501-2 by Henry VII. (it once contained
his portrait and still has that of his son Prince
Arthur and the architect, Sir Reginald Bray), is,
compared with the earlier work, a very poor affair.
The yellow stain in particular is very coarse and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
overdone, yet such was the hold which this style
had got on our countrymen that in spite of the
late date of the window there is not a hint in it of
the new ideas which were then coming in, although
it is probable that before it was finished, the
famous windows of Fairford, not forty miles away
across the Cotswolds, had at least been begun.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Fairford.</p>

<p>The old church of Fairford with its square
central tower, standing on a green slope above a
rushing trout stream, which, a few miles below,
unites with the baby Thames and makes it a
navigable river, occupies a unique position, not
merely as the only village church in England&mdash;one
may, perhaps, say in the world&mdash;which still
retains the whole of its original set of stained-glass
windows almost intact, but from the quality of
the windows themselves. Some, it is true, have
suffered damage, but there is not a subject unrecognizable,
nor a window missing.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The new
style.</p>

<p>The church was begun by John Tame, merchant
of London, and finished by his son, Sir Edward;
but since John Tame's will, dated 1496, while
bequeathing various sums for ornaments to the
church, makes no mention of the glass, it is argued
that the glass had been already ordered. The
Fairford windows are usually classed as Perpendicular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
on the strength of their association with
Perpendicular architecture and the presence of
Perpendicular detail in the canopies and elsewhere,
but it is a wholly different style to the Perpendicular
of York, of Malvern, of Warwick; the
style which, with little change, had held the field
in England since the beginning of the century.
Fairford, in fact, marks a revolution in English
stained glass. It is an early, if not the first work
of a new school which, throwing away the old
native tradition, based its style on that which had
grown up on the Continent and, still more, upon
Flemish painting. The Fairford windows represent
a phase of their art which did not last very
long, for their style soon began to assimilate itself
to that of the Renaissance. In the windows of
King's College Chapel at Cambridge you may see
the change happening, and in the latest windows
there you may also, alas! see the rapid setting in
of decadence. It was, indeed, a style which
contained in itself the seeds of decay, which
germinated all too rapidly; but these, its first-fruits,
at Fairford are magnificent, and disarm criticism.</p>

TRANSEPT OF ST. OUEN'S, ROUEN<br />
Fifteenth Century</p>
</div>

<p>They mark, as I say, a complete departure from
the older standards of English fifteenth century
glass. It is the same story, once more repeated, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
old conventions of drawing becoming out of date,
and failing to satisfy a newer generation. Of the
more advanced schools of painting, the Flemish
was the one that Englishmen were most in touch
with, and it was thence that the new school of
English glass-workers took their inspiration, with the
result that a Flemish feeling is traceable in all their
work. One immediate result of the more pictorial
standard now expected of the artist was that he
came to depend in quite a different way on the
painting of his glass as distinct from the glazing.
At Fairford, elaborate landscape backgrounds are
put in with the brown enamel alone, helped by
yellow stain, sometimes on white, sometimes on
grey-blue glass, to which latter the stain gives a
green for grass and trees. Not as yet, however,
does the painting take precedence of the glazing,
the balance being for a time held equal between
the two. Indeed the craft of glazing, as well as
that of painting, was now at its height; the artist
had all the resources of both at his command and
used them to the full, but as yet the limits of the
medium were not overstepped.</p>

<p>Another result of the pictorial standard now
arrived at, was that the artist began to feel cramped
by the narrow lights he had to fill, and to let his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
subjects spread through more than one of them,
ignoring the intervening mullion. At Fairford
many of the subjects occupy two lights, and the
"Crucifixion" at the east end and the "Doom" at
the west spread right across the whole width of the
window. As yet this is not so done that one loses
the sense of the design decorating the stone-work;
but both these developments are indications of a
tendency which was to increase as time went on,
and eventually to ruin the art.</p>

<p>The new point of view naturally affected the
canopy, which is shaded like solid stone-work, giving
it a heavy and clumsy effect. In many of the
subject windows, however, the canopy is omitted
altogether, the sky of the picture, which is sometimes
white, with clouds and circling swifts painted
on it, continuing right up to the stone-work.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The problem
of the authorship
of the
windows.</p>

<p>I agree with Mr. Westlake in finding the work
of more than one hand in the windows. Two there
are certainly, and possibly four. The east window
is certainly by a different, and, I think, an older
hand than the west, and the windows of the north
aisle, though they may be by the same hand as
the west windows, are certainly by a different one to
the Apostles opposite them, which are the poorest
windows in the church. I think the differences are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
greater than could be accounted for by any development
that might take place in the same man's
style during the execution of the windows. The
west windows are the work of a different temperament
to the east windows. The forms are fuller,
stronger, and more rounded, and show a much
stronger sense for the decorative placing of a line.</p>

<p>There is no record to tell us who these men
were, and there has been much discussion as to
whether they were Englishmen or Flemings.
Indeed the wildest theories have been advanced as
to the origin of the windows. They have been
attributed to Dürer, without the slightest internal
or external evidence except the presence of an A
which does not resemble his signature. Another
story which, though not heard of, I believe, till the
eighteenth century, has obtained wide credence, is
that they were captured at sea, bound for Rome, by
Edward Tame, and the church built to contain
them; but the most casual examination of the
windows ought to convince any one that they were
made for the church and not the church for them.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>As to the question of the English or Flemish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
authorship of the windows, it is true that Flemish
details crop up here and there both in architecture
and the costumes; but this is not surprising, for the
style, new then to England, was largely based on
Flemish art, and on the other hand the English
characteristics are in excess of the Flemish.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Barnard
Flower.</p>

<p>In Henry VII.'s Chapel at Westminster, high up
in the central clerestory window of the apse, is a
single figure under a canopy which bears a most
striking resemblance to the series of the Prophets
at Fairford (<a href="#i471">Plate L.</a>). In the figure, in the scroll
he holds, in the canopy, in the treatment of the
drapery, and even in the queer drawing of the hands,
the resemblance is so close that I for one cannot
doubt their common authorship. Now it is on
record that the windows of Henry VII.'s Chapel
were glazed by "one Barnard Flower," the king's
glazier, who also is the glazier named in the
first contract for the windows in King's College
Chapel at Cambridge, but who died in 1525-26
before they were finished. A comparison of those
windows at Cambridge which are believed to be
his work, especially that over the north door,
with the Fairford windows, reveals many points of
resemblance, and, allowing for the twenty years
which probably separate the execution of the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
works, I think we should not be far wrong in
assigning to Flower the whole of the north aisle at
Fairford, and perhaps the Latin Fathers in the
south aisle. Whether the west windows are his
work too I do not feel sure, and to the names of

The "Doom."</p>

<p>Yet though one may thus trace various hands
in the work, the windows form a connected whole,
the planning of which must have been the work of
one mind. The arrangement is the traditional one
whereby the whole church forms an exposition of
the foundations of the Christian faith. The
windows of the nave contain single figures, the
Prophets on the north side (<a href="#i471">Plate L.</a>) facing the
Apostles on the south. Each Apostle holds a verse
of the creed, and the Prophet opposite him a
corresponding verse from his writings. The four
Evangelists face the four Latin Fathers. Farther
east, within the now vanished screen, the windows
unfold the Gospel story, those on the north leading
up to the Passion in the east window, those on the
south showing the Descent into Hell, the Resurrection,
and the events that followed. Then, as the
spectator turns to the west, there faces him, in the
great west window, the tremendous "Doom" or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Last Judgment. Do not look at the upper half
where Christ sits enthroned as Judge, surrounded
by saints and angels; it has suffered the fate of the
Winchester College glass. Blown in by a storm in
1703, it was "restored" in the middle of the nineteenth
century, which means that the old glass
was removed and a bad copy substituted. Where
the blue ring of Heaven passes through the tracery
lights the original glass remains, and the difference
between it and the new is an object lesson in good
and bad stained-glass work.</p>

<p>But below the transom the window is still unspoilt.
In the midst stands Michael with sword
and scales, and below him the dead are rising naked
from their graves. Michael himself, it must be
confessed, is a somewhat lackadaisical figure; it
was not possible for an artist of that time and
school to give a figure the arresting quality of the
Methuselah in <a href="#i041">Plate III.</a>; neither does one's eye
linger long over the Saved, who troop up the
golden stairs on Michael's right, but is irresistibly
attracted to the other side of the picture, where in a
great glow of ruby glass are seen the Flames of
Hell, to which devils&mdash;grey and blue at the outer
edge of the fire, but darker and more purple as
they are farther in&mdash;are carrying the wretched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
souls of the Lost. Just outside the flames an angel
and a devil are fighting in mid-air for the possession
of a soul, and a comparison of these figures with the
similar ones in the Descent into Limbo or "Harrying
of Hell," which is by the same hand as the east
window, shows at once the difference between the
work of the two men.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The west
windows of
the aisles.</p>

<p>On either side the west windows of the aisles
contain, as types of the Last Judgment, on the
north, the Judgment of Solomon, which protected
the innocent; on the south, that of David on the
Amalekite, which condemned the guilty. It seems
to me not unlikely that the position of these
windows was originally reversed, Solomon's judgment
being on the side of the Saved in the
"Doom" and David's on that of the Lost. They
have both suffered greatly in the storm of 1703
and contain many blank spaces, but from what
remains they seem to me, together with the
"Doom," the most accomplished work in the
church.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The
clerestory.</p>

<p>Very splendid, too, are the Persecutors of the
Church, who, clad in all the bravery of wickedness,
fill the north side of the clerestory, fronting the
somewhat insipid row of Martyrs on the other side.
Here is Herod transfixing an Innocent; Nero,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
if it is he, with the head of St. Paul; the King
of the Huns, and Diocletian, perhaps, with
bows and arrows; and, in a dark blue robe,
Judas, with the halter round his neck and the
bag in his hand, between Annas and Caiaphas.
In the tracery lights above the Martyrs are
rather commonplace white and gold angels, but
over the Persecutors are fascinating little figures
of devils, grey, blue, and green, on a background
of ruby flames. I am afraid there is
no question which series the artist enjoyed doing
most!</p>

<p>Fairford marks the end of mediæval stained glass
in England. Conservative artists might still, as at
Malvern and at St. Neots in Cornwall, try to carry
on the older tradition, but their works are isolated
survivals. The Fairford windows themselves
represent, as I have said, a very short-lived phase
in English glass, of which they are the most
complete example, others being the fragments in
Henry VII.'s Chapel at Westminster and the
remains of Bishop Fox's glazing in Winchester
Cathedral, now collected into the east clerestory
window there. Flower's own work at King's
College, Cambridge, twenty years later than
Fairford, shows signs of change, and that of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
successors in the same building, as at Basingstoke,
at Balliol College and elsewhere must be classed as
wholly of the Renaissance. With Fairford, then,
these notes on Stained Glass of the Middle Ages
may fitly end.

of very good quality.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> By some writers it has been claimed that the whole idea of stained-glass
work was derived from cloisonné enamel; but from the fact that
the glazing of windows in glass and metal had been known long before,
I think the course of events I have suggested above to have been more
probable.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> There is some at Augsburg and at Tegernsee in Bavaria which
may perhaps be a little earlier, but it is not certain.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> It seems to have been the practice of glass-workers in the Middle
Ages to describe the different colours in glass by the jewel they most
nearly resembled. A survival of this at the present day is their universal
habit of calling red glass "ruby."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Some critics have thought the figure merely a copy from an
earlier design, but I cannot agree with them.</p>

of course, a fifteenth century scrap.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Were it not for the difference in the source of the light one would
be reminded of Kipling's lines:&mdash;</p>

"The first are white with the heat of Hell and the second are red with pain,"</p>

<p class="footnote">and</p>

<p class="footnote i6">The frontlet of a tortured star milk-white in Hellmouth heat."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> This is not altogether conclusive. The fleur-de-lis and castle had
been a favourite ornament in French glass since their adoption by
St. Louis.</p>

was building, and in 1320 William de Melton, who finished it.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Lasteyrie would have it that the existing windows represent this
glazing,&mdash;an extraordinary mistake for him to make,&mdash;but it is just
possible that they contain figures from the older windows.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Perhaps it is unfair to blame Thornton, for in the contract he
undertakes to work "secundum ordinationem Decani et Capituli."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> This is thought by some to be a piece of something else inserted
here, but its effect on the design is very happy.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> It is true that the glass is not now in its original position, but I
think it must always have filled two lights.</p>

is that they were the work of the Dutch painter Aeps.</p>
